The Bezold Effect was named after Wilhelm von Bezold (1837â€“1907) who
discovered it when experimenting with ways to **modify rug design
by only changing one color**.

It's pretty powerful and shows how color perception can be manipulated in
interesting ways.

We might not know exactly _why_ it happens optically, but we know that the substitution of
a single color affects the relationship of an entire color series/palette which causes a
substantial shift in designs.

The [wiki page on the Bezold Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezold_effect) shows
red bars on top of a black column and a white column. When we add a way to adjust the darkness
of one of the columns we can see the effect in action.

The red looks darker on dark colors, and becomes brighter as it lightens, despite the red bars
never changing.

export const BezoldExample = () => {
  const [darkness, setDarkness] = React.useState(0)
  const backgroundColor = `rgb(${darkness}, ${darkness}, ${darkness})`
  return (
    <div>
      <div
        style={{
          height: 328,
          position: 'relative',
          display: 'flex',
          overflow: 'hidden'
        }}
      >
        <div
          style={{
            width: '50%',
            height: '100%',
            backgroundColor,
            paddingTop: 4
          }}
        ></div>
        <div style={{ width: '50%', height: '100%' }}></div>
        <div
          style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            right: 0,
            bottom: 0,
            background:
              'repeating-linear-gradient(0deg, transparent, transparent 8px, hsl(351.1, 75.8%, 52.9%) 8px, hsl(351.1, 75.8%, 52.9%) 16px)'
          }}
        />
      </div>
      <input
        type="range"
        max="255"
        min="0"
        step="1"
        value={darkness}
        onChange={(e) => setDarkness(e.target.value)}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
