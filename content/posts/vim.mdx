I've been using vim for a while now, but it's mostly been something
where I'm _maybe_ good enough to be dangerous. But really, I'm pretty
terrible at editing text.

Generally speaking this is fine because I find it preferable to spend
more of my time thinking than typing.

However, there have definitely been moments where my lack of text
editing skills disrupt my flow state. So, 2021 will be my year of
learning vim.

Not to mention, my tendency to use the mouse too much in
VS Code seems to bring out my [RSI](/rsi) a bit.

This means I will be setting aside small amounts of time
practicing each day, and learning from my vim sensei,
[Adam Morse](https://twitter.com/mrmrs_).

I enjoy using vim because I appreciate its minimalism and remaining
in my terminal, it feels "comfy". I also purposefully use a pretty
vanilla version of vim, like most software I run (the omakase version).

I also think the small functions and commands, with their composable
nature is a great lesson in design. It's a north star for how I want
to build software at [Components AI](https://components.ai).
