If you have a bash alias and can't remember exactly
what it does, you can use the `which` command and it
will show the entire alias.

This is great for remembering what default options are
or refreshing your memory on what the more granular
parts might be.

For example, I have a `stayup` alias for my Mac which
I use to make sure my machine doesn't go to sleep while
I'm running a script.

Sometimes I might want to keep my computer awake all
night so I look up the alias and then modify the
command it maps to for my one-off need.

```sh
‚ùØ which stayup
stayup: aliased to caffeinate -u -t 3600
```
