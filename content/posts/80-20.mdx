In software we often hear the term "80/20" rule.
Depending on context it can mean a couple different
things, but first, where does it come from?

## Pareto principle

Wikipedia says that the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
states: 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes (the "vital few").

As far as I could find, this is the origin of the 80/20
terminology.

## 80/20 in software

### Time estimation

Time estimation was my first exposure to this rule in
software. In summary, it essentially says that the last 20%
of work takes 80% of the time. This is after 80% of the
time estimation was already used up for the last 80% of
work.

Thus, the shipping date will be about 160% of the estimation.
This is most likely still an improper estimate because it's
less that 2x/200%.

### Bugs

This also comes from the wiki page on the Pareto principle,
but Microsoft found that fixing the top 20% of bugs fixed
80% of the errors for a given system.

Abstractly, this does make sense, because it's often buggy
codepaths that can lean to undefined behavior in a multitude
of ways.

### Feature usage

80% of users only need 20% of the features. When you're building
things, aim for that 20%.
