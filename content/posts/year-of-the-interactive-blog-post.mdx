import * as React from 'react'

Component frameworks like React and Vue have become the norm in frontend
development. We're also seeing the pendulum swing to self-hosted platforms
as folks grow frustrated with walled gardens like Medium. I think this is
a great thing because it gives folks more flexibility with their tooling
which means more freedom for creative expression.

Also, I'm biased, but I think formats like MDX help to [promote a different
of thinking about long form content](https://twitter.com/4lpine/status/1232749214083346432)
in a more approachable way.

Originally, MDX was mostly built for interactive documentation. It wasn't
until shortly after that we saw it start to see adoption on blogs in order
to embed components.

This was surprising because it's easy to develop tunnel vision when working
on a particular application of a project. However, the thin contract MDX
exposes between Markdown and JSX has a _ton_ of potential for interactive
and immersive content.

MDX has some positive implications when it comes to long form
content because you can show _and_ tell.

export const Slider = () => {
  const [position, setPosition] = React.useState('1')
  let text = null
  if (position === '0') {
    text = 'üëà'
  } else if (position === '1') {
    text = 'üëç'
  } else if (position === '2') {
    text = 'üëâ'
  }
  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
      <h4 style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: 100 }}>{text}</h4>
      <input
        type="range"
        step="1"
        max="2"
        min="0"
        value={position}
        onChange={(e) => setPosition(e.target.value)}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

<Slider />

In 2019 we saw some interactive posts get buzz on tech Twitter, and I'm hoping
for even more during 2020.

As we realize how effective interaction and scrollytelling can be, and how authoring
technology is catching up, we will probably see a lot more content in this category. I'm
excited.
