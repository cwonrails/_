# Hello, I'm John Otander

You can usually find me on the internet as
[johno][gh] or [4lpine][tw].

I'm a web developer and designer that builds things. Lots of things.
I focus on improving design/developer tooling and making it more
approachable to build websites and applications.

I'm building [Components AI](https://components.ai), an
experimental computational design platform for exploring generative space.

I've built a few popular open source projects including
[Blocks](https://blocks-ui.com), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com),
[Tachyons](https://tachyons.io), and [CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com).

I'm part of the [unified collective](https://unifiedjs.com) and
I'm also creating a course, [Compilers for Humans](https://compilersforhumans.com)
that seeks to show you that compilers aren't magic.
