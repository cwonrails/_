I've begun recording some of the stuff I build and work on
to show how I approach web development, and more generally,
work through problems.

It's meant to illustrate the unglamorous, like copy/pasting
code from old projects or `console.log` debugging. They're
unedited and full of me mumbling.

## Screencasts

I've begun instructing on egghead, so if you are interested you can
find them all below. They're edited, egghead-style which means they're short,
technical, punches to the face.

Oh, and they're free!
