# 2020 reading list

Below is a collection of books that I've read in 2020 that made an impact on me
in some way.

**10/10** Great read, especially for writers and students.

This was a book recommended by [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com) that was one
of those I devoured in two sittings. I'd summarize it as exposing a framework that
helps empower folks researching and writing to do so more effectively. It diverges
from common note taking approaches and teaches a "slip-box" approach pioneered by
Niklas Luhmann.

It's particularly interesting to me because I've been exploring the "digital garden"
for a while and this had a lot of similar ideas. Writing is fundamental to thinking,
and writing evolves over time. It isn't linear. In fact, it's sort of a graph of
connections of abstract thinking.
