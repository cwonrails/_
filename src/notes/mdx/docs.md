# Docs feedback

The following feedback was received during some user
interviews with a handful of folks with varying MDX
and front-end experience.

## User 1

- Why not what narrative
- "in one place" => "to all child documents"
- Remove `<>` syntax in examples, use known html entities like `<main>`
- define authorable format
- "Component era" sounds like hype language
- Code editor isn't obvious it's editable
- Getting Started is too long, separate
  - Getting Started
  - Syntax => Usage
- Exports: "it's" => "this"

## User 2

- Live editor isn't obviously editable
  - maybe make it side by side
- Unable to find getting started
- Working with components section needs comments to describe code

## User 3

- Demo is helpful, but hidden
- Customizable feature bullet point is confusing
  - "Customize the display of each Markdown element (# => <Heading.H1)"
- Embed video in why?
- In "try to make the text green" make the solution togglable
- Make all code blocks interactive?
- Use getting started to introduce concepts, link to advanced section for deep dives (like exports)
- Add tutorial section
