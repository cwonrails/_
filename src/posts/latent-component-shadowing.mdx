With Gatsby Themes we've been thinking about the different layers that
will likely exist in the ecosystem. When I try to boil it down I end up
with something like:

- **Data Model:** The real-world view of your data (BlogPost, PortfolioItem, StoreItem, etc.)
- **Templating:** Runs GraphQL queries and programmatically creates pages
- **Rendering:** Accepts props and renders React components

## Emerging patterns

The Data Model handles the sourcing of data and its
transformation to a standard type/schema. In the wild there are pretty
standardized object types like BlogPosts and StoreItems so we could
expose officially supported models.

Additionally, the templating system is something that's pretty standard
as well. Blog posts might be rendered to different pages like `/writing`
or `/thoughts` in place of `/blog` but that's a configuration detail. If
we also expose a standard set of templating themes we open up a new layer
for themes developers that can operate _entirely_ in the React/styling
world without touching `gatsby-node.js` or GraphQL.

## Rendering

The rendering layer is where we'll see a lot of exciting innovation since
suddenly designers and developers will be able to build powerful Gatsby
sites and applications without needing to learn Gatsby's node APIs or
GraphQL. This is great because we can now operate at a new layer of abstraction
that [progressively discloses complexity](https://lengstorf.com/progressive-disclosure-of-complexity/).

In essence, new themes will be able to be built on top of other themes
that leverage Component Shadowing to tap into the rendering of a page
and customize it.

## Horizontal composition

We anticipate horizontal composition to be a common pattern for combining
themes together. When you think about the architecture of websites, they're
often grouped based on their data source.

So we can consider a scenario where a theme author wants to build `gatsby-theme-tomato`
which supports a blog, portfolio, and ecommerce store. Then end user of
the theme, if using all three sources, would end up with a theme composition
looking like the following:

```
shopify => gatsby-data-ecommerce => gatsby-theme-ecommerce  \
                                                             \
contentful => gatsby-data-blog => gatsby-theme-blog --------- gatsby-theme-tomato
                                                              /
instagram => gatsby-data-portfolio => gatsby-theme-portfolio /
```

Ideally, `gatsby-theme-tomato` would be able to build React components that
interfaced with the themes above and not need to know about how they source
data or even render the templates. With Component Shadowing, this is possible!

## Gatsby Theme Tomato

If we know the architecture of a theme that we'll support we can
now create a "bag of components" that are built around Latent Component Shadowing. This
allows the `gatsby-theme-tomato` developer to support a collection of built in themes
that are automatically activated when the data source and template are "turned on"
when a theme like `gatsby-theme-blog` is installed and configured.

```
├── gatsby-theme-tomato
   ├── gatsby-config.js
   ├── gatsby-node.js
   ├── package.json
   └── src
       ├── components
       │   ├── header.js
       │   ├── footer.js
       │   ├── layout.js
       │   ├── ...
       ├── gatsby-theme-blog
       │   └── components
       │       ├── post.js
       │       └── posts.js
       ├── gatsby-theme-store
       │   └── components
       │       └── store.js
       ├── gatsby-theme-portfolio
           ├── portfolio.js
           └── portfolio-item.js
```

If a user starts with the following config:

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: ['gatsby-theme-blog', 'gatsby-theme-tomato']
}
```

All the blog posts will be rendered by `gatsby-theme-tomato` because the theme is
shadowing the Post and Posts components which are being rendered by the templates
in `gatsby-theme-blog`.

Then, down the road a user might decide they want to add a portfolio:

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [
    'gatsby-theme-blog',
    'gatsby-theme-portfolio',
    'gatsby-theme-tomato'
  ]
}
```

When `gatsby develop` is restarted, `gatsby-theme-tomato` takes over the
rendering of the portfolio theme as well.

This is leveraging Latent Component Shadowing.

## A real world application

I'm currently working on a project called
[Digital Garden](https://github.com/johno/digital-garden) that is using
Latent Component Shadowing.

The idea is that `gatsby-theme-digital-garden` is the base. It sources your
`notes` directory and creates pages for each note and a directory listing.
This is the default behavior and is meant to be mixed in with any existing
Gatsby site.

However, I want to be able to add in additional functionality to the ecosystem
if you're starting with the base. So, for my own site I wanted blog functionality
as well. So I've added `gatsby-theme-digital-garden-blog` which is intended to be
a sibling of `gatsby-theme-digital-garden`. All components and styling thus live
in the base theme and lay dormant _until_ `gatsby-theme-digital-garden-blog`
activates.

```
├── gatsby-theme-digital-garden
│   └── src
│       ├── components
│       │   ├── directory-list.js
│       │   ├── file-list.js
│       │   ├── header.js
│       │   ├── layout.js
│       │   ├── note.js
│       │   ├── notes.js
│       │   └── ui.js
│       ├── gatsby-theme-digital-garden-blog
│       │   └── components
│       │       ├── header.js
│       │       ├── layout.js
│       │       ├── post.js
│       │       └── posts.js
│       ├── templates
│       │   ├── note.js
│       │   └── notes.js
└── gatsby-theme-digital-garden-blog
    └── src
        └── templates
            ├── post.js
            └── posts.js
```

It's an interesting approach because the rendering of any theme in the Digital
Garden ecosystem is supported in the base theme and the templating for some
functionality like the blog or portfolio needs to be installed and added to
the Gatsby config:

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [
    'gatsby-theme-digital-garden',
    'gatsby-theme-digital-garden-blog'
  ]
}
```

### Why should the base theme handle rendering?

In the context of Digital Garden, I want a single design token configuration to
automatically apply to all components. Down the road we'll also add functionality
like light/dark mode and other ways to customize layouts and other aspects.

Due to these needs it makes sense for all the components to be colocated. You could
also break out these components to a standalone npm library that's shared amongst
all Digital Garden themes, but these components will only ever be used as a Gatsby
theme so there isn't a need.

## Conclusion

Latent Component Shadowing can be a powerful way as a theme author to add support for a collection
of themes that handle data sourcing, page creation, and templating. You can operate
solely at the React level and build new things without needing to dive into the lower
levels of Gatsby until you need to. You simply write components that lay dormant until
they're activated by a sibling theme.
