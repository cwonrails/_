When you're processing a JSX AST you might want to remove
a function based on its function name.

You can use the `FunctionDeclaration` visitor and then
check the function name at `path.node.id.name` where
`id` refers to the function's "identifier".

If you're only looking for a particular function that
will only be found once in a file, don't forget to
optimize with `path.stop()` which will stop the visitor
from continuing to traverse the tree.

All together:

```js
export default () => {
  return {
    visitor: {
      FunctionDeclaration(path) {
        if (path.node.id.name === '_extends') {
          path.remove()
          path.stop()
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
