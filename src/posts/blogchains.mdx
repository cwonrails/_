I first heard about the concept of a blogchain from Tom Chritchlow's post
_[Building Blogchains](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/07/17/blogchains/)_.
This experiment of his was derived from Venkatesh Rao's post
_[Constructions in magical thinking](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/21/constructions-in-magical-thinking/)_.

The idea is that "megaposts" are broken into smaller, fixed length
posts that are linked together. They're informally developed or
improvised over time rather than something outlined from the
beginning.

## Goodbye _megapost_

As a digital gardener over the last year or so I've definitely seen
where this can be valuable. I've found that "megaposts" can
easily become a time sink when they grow and grow. Over time they become
rather daunting to pick up and can linger around for weeks before you
**press that publish button**.

I've naturally begun breaking my megaposts into smaller bits in the spirit
of continually shipping, however I never really bothered to interlink or
connect them aside from adding tags.

I thought Venkatesh's anaerobic vs aerobic comparison was pretty apt.

## Hello bite-sized posts

When it comes to writing consistently over a long period of time, I like
the idea of aerobic style content production. It's inherently more flexible
and allows ideas our topics to develop more fluidly.

As Chris Biscardi says, "runners have to manage their limits", which is something
the blogchain seems to bake in. It's not a push to the finish in one fell swoop.
We're evolving to something more cohesive and finished.

I think the blogchain and bite-sized post concept lends itself better to the
digital garden.

## Writing is exploration

In _Building Blogchains_, Tom Critchlow said that blogchains open up the
possibility for "infinite, open-ended world building" which resonates with
me rather profoundly.

I like to write about what I'm researching and what I'm building for my
job, side projects, and even random things I decide to read. I'm not typically
traveling to some known far away land. It's exploratory.

**I'm constructing a map as I explore in varying directions, slowly gaining
more context on my surroundings.**

When I'm researching one topic I'll often go off in a new direction when
something strikes my fancy. These tangents are just as valuable as my initial
target.

So long as I'm writing it all down, and connecting it together, what I'm
looking for will fade into view eventually.

It's like you're wandering in the woods and decided that you're going to
head towards a particular mountaintop, but in the valley you encounter
a river you want to follow along for a while. You'll start heading towards
the mountain again, but your perspective might be different.

There might be rad shit along the river, too. Waterfalls are cool.

### Departing from the blog series

The blog series has been around for a long time, but I think the blogchain
itself is a departure. My mental model for the blog series is something that's
planned out and outlined well in advance and you work to complete each part.

The blogchain is freeform and exploratory.

## Can I chain to your blogchain?

This is something that's been on the internet for basically _forever_.
Usenet, forums, even Facebook and Twitter have this notion of continuing
on with, or reacting to, someone else's content or ideas.

It's just we may have loss the care in our responses as modern social
media has adopted a "shoot from the hip" approach rather than more long
form reflection. Also, Twitter can be a bit restrictive considering the
character limits.

Though, something that's interesting is many folks will use Twitter threads
as a mechanism for producing something longer form, in some ways the character
limit constraint can help folks develop thought more effectively.

Not me though, I'd rather write 300 words on something you can summarize
in 20.

Most importantly, though, we result in distribution which runs contrary
to the centralization we've unfortunately seen on the web over the last
decade or two.

Back to interconnecting blog chains.

Sometimes you want to remix someone's idea, maybe their idea inspired
you to think about something completely tangential and seemingly unrelated.
Either way, you can connect this content together, interlinking ideas with
their origins and derivatives.

This is dope.

### This very post is part of a greater blogchain

In all reality, what I'm writing is another blogchain step that's a
continuation of my thoughts regarding Tom Critchlow's blogchain blogchain.
This is an interconnected blogchain to a blogchain on blogchains.

Yes, you read that right.

But, as Brendan Schlagel brought up in
_[Weaving a public web, or, why I don't blog more](https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2019/09/01/weaving-a-public-web-or-why-dont-i-blog-more/)_,
we still have issues with discoverability. How do you find the interconnected
blogchains? How can you curate them?

I don't have an answer or even an idea aside from manually cut and
pasting links. But, not everyone's content is just a GitHub PR away.

Josh Comeau might [be onto something regarding webrings](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1168623705347543051).

## Conclusion

I'm pretty intrigued by the concept of blogchains and will be working it
into my site. I'm also pretty interested from the idea of interlinking
blogchains to form more of a tree structure.

I rarely travel in a straight line, which is something the blogchain sort
of implies.
