There are many ways that you can automate creating a
new blog post. For me, I've opted to keep it simple
with a bash script that creates the necessary minimal
frontmatter and then creates the file.

It even goes so far as reading user input for the title.

## User input

In order to read the user input I use the `read` command
and assign it to a variable.

```sh
echo "Name of post"

read NAME

echo $NAME
```

## Slugify a string

Next, I turn a title into a slug for both the url of
the post and the file that I write to disk.

I achieve this by:

- echoing the name
- replacing spaces with hypens
- lowercasing
- removing non-alphanumeric characters

```sh
SLUG=$(
  echo "$NAME" |
  sed 's/ /-/g' |
  tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
  tr -cd '[:alnum:]_-'
)
```

## Getting the date

Bash comes with a `date` command that defaults to the current
date and has formatting options. Here I want the `yyyy-mm-dd`
format.

```sh
DATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')
```

## Initializing frontmatter

I then create a string for the frontmatter using the variables
I've instantiated.

```sh
FRONTMATTER=$(cat <<-END
---
title: $NAME
slug: /$SLUG
date: $DATE
---
END)
```

## Write the frontmatter to disk

And then we write the frontmatter string to the `src/posts`
directory.

```sh
echo "$FRONTMATTER" > src/posts/$SLUG.mdx
```

## Conclusion

There are many different ways to achieve this automation. In
fact, any programming language will allow you to do this, potentially
even with less code.

However, I opted to use bash because it's the lowest common
denominator for all machines I work on and any future versions
of my blog will be compatible.

### Full bash script

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Name of post"

read NAME

SLUG=$(echo "$NAME" | sed 's/ /-/g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cd '[:alnum:]_-')
DATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')

FRONTMATTER=$(cat <<-END
---
title: $NAME
slug: /$SLUG
date: $DATE
---
END)

echo "$FRONTMATTER" > src/posts/$SLUG.mdx
```
