In [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com) they describe a
_fragment shader_ as a Gutenberg press for graphics. This analogy is pretty
apt, since each pixel on the screen is a character on the printing press.
Though, of course, shaders can compute billions of pixels a second whereas
the printing press is entirely manual.

A _shader_, at its simplest, is a function that returns four values:
_r_, _g_, _b_, and _a_. The value that is described maps to a _vertex_
or _pixel_ which affects the overall appearance of the screen by
updating/computing all pixels on the screen individually.

It gets powerful because a shader can be used
to return the computed color for every pixel on a screen very rapidly.
This is very useful for video games, complex modeling software, and
any other 3D or graphics-heavy applications.

Shaders are processed in a parallel fashion, which allows for them to
perform well. GPUs are very good at computing large sets of simple calculations
which is exactly what shaders do.

On the other hand, CPUs are best for a small collection of hard tasks.
This makes the CPU a terrible fit for rapidly computing pixels for a
screen.

## With power comes responsibility

Shaders are notoriously difficult to deal with because they are threaded
and each thread is _blind_ to the other. This means that they must operate
independently which is a difficult programming model for humans. We typically
visualize things in a connected fashion.

## Stages of the rendering pipeline

There are multiple stages of the
[rendering pipeline](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Shader#Stages)
that a shader might run on.

- Vertex
- Evaluation
- Geometry
- Fragment
- Compute
