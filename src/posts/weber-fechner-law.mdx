This law is the mash up of two hypotheses in psychophysics
and human perception.

**We as humans don't perceive much change, if at all, unless
there's a large, proportional magnitude.**

It's particularly interesting in design because type, space,
and color scales, can drop a lot of middling values and focus
on something closer to a power of two.
