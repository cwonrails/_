The very day that GitHub announced GitHub Codespaces I impulsively purchased the
iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil. It’s a device I’d definitely
been pondering a bunch, because I’ve been interested in lighter weight devices
for work, but it never felt like I could get any real development done since my
workflow is git + VSCode/vim and lots of writing in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).

GitHub Codespaces sort of changed all that, so I got mad excited and made the
purchase.

Overall I’ve been pretty impressed so far. The keyboard has a _decent_ feel
to it, and will hopefully last longer than my MacBook Air which needs to be
repaired yet again.

The mobile OS is a bit weird to get used to when switching tabs, apps, etc.
But it’s still feeling surprisingly efficient (I’m currently typing on this
machine as we speak).

There’s still a bit to be desired in GitHub Codespaces (understandably being a
beta) so it won’t become my primary development machine anytime soon. But, it
might be my primary writing machine. It sort of already is.

Also, my daughter fucking loves Procreate with the Pencil.
