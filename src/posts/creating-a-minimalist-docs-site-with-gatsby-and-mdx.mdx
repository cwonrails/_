Good open source projects need great docs, so I've built a
[Gatsby Theme](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes) to make it
quick to get up and running with a minimal docs site.

I've given it the completely uncreative name
[gatsby-theme-documentation](https://github.com/johno/gatsby-theme-documentation).

Below will walk through turning a directory of Markdown/MDX files
into a full-fledged docs site (that even looks nice).

## Scaffolding

```sh
gatsby new new-docs johno/gatsby-starter-documentation
cd new-docs
```

Now, copy in your directory of Markdown/MDX files:

```sh
rm -rf docs
mv ../docs docs
```

Then, run the server to render your docs pages:

```sh
yarn start
```

## Change the sidebar

You'll likely notice that the sidebar navigation isn't
correct for your newly created docs. In order to change them
you can write a Markdown list at
`src/gatsby-theme-documentation/sidebar.mdx`:

```mdx
- [Introduction](/)
- [Tutorial](/tutorial)
- [Getting Started](/getting-started)
- [Contributing](/contributing)
- [FAQ](/faq)
```

## Update the heading information

You can also update the header data and links by changing
`src/gatsby-theme-documentation/header.mdx`.

```mdx
# ![Docs Logo](https://contrast.now.sh/white/black?width=80&height=40&text=NEWDOCS)

[GitHub](https://github.com/my/repo)
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/my-twitter)
```

## Change the theme tokens

Then, if you want to change some color in your theme or even things like the font
family or font size, open up `src/gatsby-theme-documentation/theme.js` and watch
any changes hot reload in front of you.

## Conclusion

If you want to only write MDX and get a docs site running quickly without having
to do much design, [gatsby-theme-documentation](https://github.com/johno/gatsby-theme-documentation)
is a great way to do that.

## Acknowledgements

The majority of the code in this theme was originally written by
[Brent Jackson](https://jxnblk.com). I mostly just converted it to a theme and
added header/sidebar shadowing.

If you have a need for more complex features or are building a design system, it's
recommended to check out [Docz](https://docz.site). It's a more feature-rich project
that comes with batteries included.
