If you're using Netlify Functions for a separate API
that might be requested from the browser you'll need
to add [CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

For large APIs with many functions I'll typically
write a helper utility, but here I'll show you how
I do a one-off implementation.

Create a `CORS_HEADERS` constant with the proper
headers. This allows all origins. If you know that
your requests will only come from a particular URL
I'd recommend setting that (and probably adding
localhost).

```js
const CORS_HEADERS = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers':
    'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept',
}
```

Check for the `OPTIONS` request from the browser
and return the CORS headers.

```js
exports.handler = async (event, _context) => {
  if (event.httpMethod === 'OPTIONS') {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: CORS_HEADERS,
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

Return the CORS headers with the JSON response:

```js
return {
  statusCode: 200,
  headers: {
    ...CORS_HEADERS,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    hello: 'browser!'
  })
}
```

## Conclusion

It's a bit clunky to have to manually handle
the `OPTIONS` request that checks for the
proper CORS headers, but generally speaking
it works and doesn't obfuscate what's happening
if you're working on a pretty simple project
that only has one endpoint.

### All together

```js
const CORS_HEADERS = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers':
    'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept',
}

exports.handler = async (event, _context) => {
  if (event.httpMethod === 'OPTIONS') {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: CORS_HEADERS,
    }
  }

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {
      ...CORS_HEADERS,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      hello: 'browser!'
    })
  }
}
```
