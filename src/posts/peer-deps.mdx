This is a question I get with a lot of the projects I work on, so I
thought I'd elaborate a bit.

## What is a peer dependency?

First, let's break down what a peer dependency is. A peer dependency is
a dependency of a library that **isn't automatically installed**. A library
will often specify a peer dependency when it wants a dependency to be installed
along with it.

For example, using `gatsby-plugin-mdx`, you're told to [run the following
install command](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/):

```sh
yarn add gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
```

MDX core and its React implementation (`@mdx-js/mdx` and `@mdx-js/react`) are
_peer dependencies_ of `gatsby-plugin-mdx`.

## Why use a peer dependency?

I've been an advocate for using peer dependencies in consuming libraries
because it provides a few key advantages for folks.

Firstly, it allows for users to upgrade the core library. So, you don't
have to wait for `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to upgrade its MDX dependencies every
time a new version is published. The user is in control.

Though, more importantly, a peer dependency is more resilient to issues
in runtimes. This is particularly important for libraries that use React
context like MDX and even [Emotion](https://emotion.sh).

If a library specifies its own version of React/MDX/Emotion/etc. it can
end up with multiple versions on the client. This will cause conflicts
with React, where context will disappear.

Have you ever had weird issues with MDX or Theme UI where styling and/or
components seemingly disappear? This is typically what happens when
there are conflicting versions of React context. Things break down
in weird ways.

Ultimately, this is a shortcoming in package management. But, it's tough
to solve so library authors are often forced to work around it.

## How does it happen?

When there are conflicting versions of a package you end up with nested
`node_modules` which webpack will bundle together rather than explicitly
resolving to the "same module".

```txt
node_modules/
  react/
  some-dependency/
    node_modules/
      react/
```

The above will typically result in two Reacts on the page if you don't
explicitly set a [yarn resolution](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/).

## Making the happy path for newcomers simpler

You'll likely notice a few shortcomings of the peer dependency approach.
Firstly, peer dependency handling in yarn/npm is
[substandard at best](https://twitter.com/4lpine/status/1218582668771639296).

New users becoming that are new to the terminal and CLI commands will worry
about the numerous peer dependency warnings that are incorrectly shown. This
isn't a great DX for new users.

This is a problem.

Seasoned users know to ignore them, and typically won't even read the output.
Meanwhile, newer folks are presented with a poor experience leaving them feel
confused. As library authors we should be doing our best to make newer folks
feel taken care of.

There's also the long install command. When a newcomer sees a long CLI command
they could be unsurprisingly deterred.

```sh
yarn add gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
```

What if we simplified it? (I plan on doing exactly this in MDX v2)

```sh
yarn add mdx gatsby-plugin-mdx
```

## Conclusion

Peer dependencies are a useful pattern to avoid duplicated libraries ending
up on the client, but it's likely not worth it for most usecases.

I'll be trying to document known resolution errors (like missing styles) and
instructing folks to use yarn resolutions when needed.
