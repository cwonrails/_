Friction affects our productivity, it affects our creativity. It shapes the
way we work, and not always in a good way.

When friction is increased it's like we get stuck in the mud. When it's lowered, the
floodgates are opened. We're freed.

What does this mean in terms of tooling? Something that is difficult or time consuming
to change is full of friction. Something that is easy to change, or play with, is low
friction.

If experimentation or exploration is full of friction, we're less likely to break
the mold and instead we'll continue with small, incremental changes. This is why
I'm interested in concepts like computational and parametric design. It allows us
to rapidly experiment and be creative.

**Consider a common workflow for designing a button**

We often start by determining what aesthetics in the button we want. There are
a lot of decisions that need to be made.

- colors
- font size
- font family
- font weight
- border radius
- padding
- box shadow
- text decoration
- variants
- hover
- focus

If you have to manually conceptualize and create button designs in a traditional
tool it can take 1-10 minutes to create each one. This will only allow you to try out
10-60 button variations in an hour. This is high friction.

What if our tools knew what a button was and variations were generated for us?
What if our tools already have knowledge about branding and use that information
to intelligently suggest button designs?

This would drastically lower friction and allow us to hone in on the button we're
looking for. As humans we're very good at searching and curating, yet our tools
make it time consuming to walk through variations. Manipulation of our canvas is
too granular.

When it comes to designing and building webpages there is a lot of context we can
infer from the user, and a lot of commonalities on the web in general, which we
can leverage to make better predictions around what the user wants.

We can remove friction.

So we should.

This was a collection of thoughts I had after reading Jason Lengstorf's post:
