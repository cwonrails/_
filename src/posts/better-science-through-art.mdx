Notes from reading along with
[Better science through art](http://dreamsongs.com/Files/BetterScienceThroughArt.pdf)
by Richard P. Gabriel and Kevin J. Sullivan.

Science itself is very failure prone, because hundreds of experiments
can fail. It's quite possible that one will never succeed in a particular
area. Though, you can spin it that this isn't failure because you've
succeeded in learning about what doesn't work.

## Exploration is the beginning and the process

"Exploration is opening the mind to possibilities". Discovery itself
can be literal or the result of a "guess" or "hunch".

> “exploration is assertive action in the face of
> uncertain assumptions, often involving false starts, missteps,
> and surprises”

## Language

Programming languages are typically deeply rooted in natural language.
Less so math, which might seem counter-intuitive to the outsider. **I
often like to say that programming and code is about communication.
You want to signify your intent to the next person that comes along
to read the code. The machine is an afterthought.**

## Abduction

Charles Sanders Peirce recognized that induction and deduction are
based on assumptions, which don't help you come up with new ideas.
So, he proposed _abduction_.

> Now, that the matter of no new truth can come
> from induction or from deduction, we have seen. It
> can only come from abduction; and abduction is, after
> all, nothing but guessing. We are therefore bound to
> hope that, although the possible explanations of our
> facts may be strictly innumerable, yet our mind will
> be able, in some finite number of guesses, to guess the
> sole true explanation of them. That we are bound to
> assume, independently of any evidence that it is true.
> Animated by that hope, we are to proceed to the construction
> of a hypothesis.

> &mdash; Charles Sanders Peirce
