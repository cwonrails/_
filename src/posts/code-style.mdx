- **Working code is better than clean code.** We like to spend a lot of time bikeshedding
  about formatting, functional or not functional, and other trivialities when we should be
  more worried about whether it works.
- **If code reviews include nitpicks like whitespace formatting your tooling is wrong.**
  Code reviews should be about substance, APIs, and architecture.
- **Public APIs are more important than internal code style.** The code inside a function
  can be refactored at any time. The Public API is set in stone.
- **Functional programming is worth the investment.** There can be a learning curve to
  FP, especially in languages that aren't truly functional, but avoiding mutation and
  imperative loops help you to avoid subtle bugs, especially in concurrent systems.
  But we can't forget, "working code is better than functional code".
- **Smaller functions aren't always better.** Restricting/linting function length is
  an arbitrary heuristic that can lead to worse code. A function is a unit of work, not a
  daisy chain of two line methods.
- **Code generation is a beautiful thing.** It's often more work up front, and sometimes
  harder to reason about, but code you don't write is code that doesn't break. One example
  of this is generating GraphQL types from a resource's schema/validation. It's common in
  systems to propagate changes throughout a codebase in many different files when you do
  something trivial like add a property. In complex systems it's easy to "forget a place"
  and have to spend hours debugging.
- **There's nothing wrong with copy paste**.
