It's a meme in blogging that everytime you go to write a post
you have to rearchitect your blog. It's sort of unfortunate
but also understandable. I've done the exact same thing multiple
times and have gone years without writing a single thing publically
outside of GitHub.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great way to play with tech, and if
you enjoy that process, that's great!

However, at the same time you can parallelize that rearchitecting
the blog work while you also work on that post.

**Just write.**

What you write doesn't need to be perfect either. Get it onto
the page. Start your digital garden. Begin tending it over time.

When you finish your new blog project, move the content over. It's
all about incremental improvements and constantly shipping.

If you don't have a blog yet, that's cool too. There are plenty
of cool products out there to work with. Whether it's Notion,
Roam, Dropbox Paper, DEV, you can create an account to get writing
right away.

**Just write.**
