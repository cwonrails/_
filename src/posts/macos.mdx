Itâ€™s 2019 and our options for personal computing are truly dismal.

However, Iâ€™m a developer which means that I spend a lot of time in the terminal. As such, I've become accustomed to the \*nix development environment and require it for my work flow. This leaves me with two options: Linux or MacOS.

I use MacOS because I want something that "just works". I don't enjoy debugging obscure problems when trying to get my external monitor to work. I'm not really the tinkerer type so a custom Linux machine isn't a good fit. I want the basics to work so I can spend my time hacking on stuff that I'm more interested in like developer and design tooling.

This isn't really a choice I make willingly, though. The cost of a MacBook has always been too high. But I've ignored that because I like that most everything sort of works (assuming I have the dongle). The design of the laptops are nice, too.

But, the last couple years have left a sour taste in my mouth.

First, the elephant in the room, the keyboards no longer work. I've used every generation of butterfly keyboard and it's terrible. I literally can't type things on my 8 month old machine and need to get it repaired. This is bizarre to me and the latest generation doesn't work either. I travel with an external keyboard now ðŸ™ƒ.

There are also other more "paper cut" style issues. My laptop and phone have different headphone jacks.

This isn't intended to be a rant on "OMG Apple sucks", but how a seemingly inconsequential detail leaves me essentially jailed by MacOS. It's hegemony really. I want a decent, \*nix laptop that doesn't force me to spend hours and hours configuring my system. At some point I might need to be less lazy and go all in on a Linux machine.

I think there's an opportunity for a new consumer-grade laptop. The only silver lining is the fact that more and more of my workflow is based on the web, so someday maybe I'll just need a tablet.
