For the last few months while at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) I've been working on [Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/tags/themes).
As a result of this work I've been thinking about what the future of "styling themes" might look like. I.e., what's the best set of tools to use
and how we can standardize around forward-thinking conventions. I don't think this necessarily requires us to predict the future but it's also
important to find an approach that steers folks towards the pit of success, increases flexibility/interoperability, and minimizes tech debt.

Through this process I've done a large amount of research, experimentation, and analysis which I've (incompletely) documented below.
This was done for Gatsby Themes, but most of it should be applicable to other frameworks and tools as well.

### 📡 A lay of the land

To get started it's important to describe what questions I was seeking to answer:

- How can we standardize on a set of conventions that is both intuitive and productive for theme authors?
- How can we make it _simple_ to make theme modifications?
- What is an acceptable learning curve?
- What's the best fit?

It's important that theme styling is robust, flexible, and composable. After all, it's realistic to expect Gatsby sites to compose multiple
themes and we want that process to be the best that it can possibly be. Standardizing some type of convention or set of conventions will ensure
that themes which "opt in" will typically be composable with each other without issue.

Another interesting thing is we need a way to allow users to productively build two types of component classes: application UI and content. Their
concerns are related, and in the perfect world, will draw from the same design system, but their implementations often diverge in practice.

## BEM or BEM-like

I originally came to the scene during the Less/Sass and Bootstrap era and built numerous production apps with Bootstrap and custom themes (many of which I built from scratch).
It was wonderfully powerful how you could build UI quickly but always snowballed out of control. Always. Custom styling required complex
configuration and inevitably required insane selectors. It was brittle and you were left feeling like you were fighting the framework.

Not to mention, it often became difficult to keep things consistent. CSS often became riddled with magic numbers and one-off styles that
made entire components unable to be reused. With themes this style approach is untenable. It's impossible to know what themes will conflict
with each other and we need something that's more expressive.

This style approach is also something that theme authors can pursue if they like, it just doesn't make sense to be used as "The Gatsby Way".

### An experiment

Nevertheless, CSS has some powerful new features like [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*), so we
should at least give it a shot.

So Brent Jackson and I began building a collection of blog themes that used them. The motivation was that
if it's plain CSS it might be more accessible to folks. However, custom properties were difficult because they looked cryptic
and we ended up with `gatsby-theme-blog-dark` that was essentially nothing more than an export of overridden variables:

```css
:root {
  --background-color: black;
  --color: white;

  --p-line-height: 1.6;

  --table-th-border-top: thin solid;
  --table-th-border-bottom: thin solid;
  --table-th-border-color: #444;
  --table-th-background-color: #333;
  --table-th-font-size: inherit;
  --table-th-color: white;
  --table-th-font-weight: 600;
  --table-th-padding: 10px;

  --table-td-border-top: none;
  --table-td-border-bottom: thin solid;
  --table-td-border-color: #333;
  --table-td-font-size: inherit;
  --table-td-font-weight: inherit;
  --table-td-padding: 10px;

  --blockquote-font-size: 36px;
  --blockquote-color: #ccc;

  --pre-background-color: #333;
  --pre-padding: 20px;
}
```

Not to mention this is susceptible to clashing with other themes.
Themes can introduce their own variables that clash with others, and not to mention,
the load order can potentially affect the CSS order on the page.
Non-determinism like this is problematic.

The good part about this experiment is it did start to really
bring home that themes can often boil down to key value pairs, and seemed to lend itself to something JS object-based.
It was also cool to be able to _very_ quickly crank out multiple themes with drastically different styling in a matter of minutes.

## Functional/atomic/utility CSS

I rode the functional CSS bandwagon for quite some time
([OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss)/[SuitCSS](https://suitcss.github.io/)/[Basscss](http://basscss.com)/[Tachyons](https://tachyons.io))
and even co-authored a popular library. I had come to prefer it to other approaches for styling components. The lessons and
concepts that arose from this new styling approach were interesting (some even unexpected):

- Performance by default is important
- Responsive design was _fun_
- Many folks were very unhappy with existing approaches
- Concepts were quick to grasp for newcomers to web development
- Style composition is best at the component level and made prototyping in the browser unbelievably quick
- Design system constraints are powerful (and developers love them)

One of my favorite parts is the constraint-based system and the ability to rapidly design responsive components. Working with
media queries when designing in the browser is high friction (IMO) and the colocation of markup, styles, and breakpoints creates
a workflow that's amazing.

It removed a lot of the cognitive overhead when designing in the browser and everything fit a predictable pattern. No longer did
I have to remember what the second step of my spacing scale is or how to change the padding for large viewports. No longer did I
have to open up a CSS file and develop with two files simultaneously.

Of the approaches discussed so far I think it's the first that has potential. However, class composition feels really awkward with
components and there's a lot of duplication because making components a "bag of props" requires handwaving and indirection. Especially
when a prop or variant causes multiple style changes. For example:

```js
import classNames from 'classnames'

export const ListItem = ({ variant, children }) => {
  const cx = classNames('pa3 bb b--light-silver', {
    'o-80 strike mid-gray bg-near-white': variant === 'done'
  })

  return <li className={cx} children={children} />
}
```

Above, the `variant` property is a nice component API so when your list item is completed you can do something like
`<ListItem variant={item.state} />`. However this prop results in multiple changes in styling that map to multiple utility
classes. And I know what a few of you are probably saying right now, "use `extend`", but you're going to bloat your stylesheet
and have too much potential for namespace clashing.

> Functional CSS is a wonderful abstraction over the design system but it's not a great abstraction over CSS and the DOM.

Ultimately, it's an awesome approach, but it's making developers do what tooling should do. They have to think like compilers
to overcome CSS's shortcomings. Not to mention, functional CSS doesn't lend itself well to content heavy websites. You're forced
to write global styles, `extend`, or created custom rendered components for elements that end up looking like
`<p {...props} className="lh-copy f3 f4-l measure" />`.

### Theming

When it comes to theming in functional CSS, things also get interesting. The powerful part is that classes can be dynamically
generated based on your design system tokens, however, composing themes becomes problematic. It really only operates at the
page level because it's global CSS, and combining Gatsby Themes can still suffer from namespace clashing.

If two themes bring `bg-red`, who wins?

**Advantages**

- Generally applicable to the web even outside the React ecosystem
- Responsive design is intuitive
- Forces consistent UI via constraints
- Can be generated by a theme at build time
- Low-likelihood of class collisions and specificity issues
- Seeing widespread adoption (even in Bootstrap now)

**Disadvantages**

- Working with class composition in components is cumbersome
- One-off styles (common in App UI) are difficult
- Styles/classes are still global

## CSS Modules

CSS Modules are an interesting candidate. It helps reduce a lot of issues with the global namespace in CSS and it works out
of the box with Gatsby.

It does make things unclear sometimes. For Gatsby in particular you're left wondering, should I shadow the CSS file or the component?
Introducing another state might even require you to shadow both files. Additionally, when it comes to handling dynamic styling, it's
typically achieved through adding and removing a particular class. This is relatively intuitive for web developers but feels like a
bit of indirection in the React ecosystem.

Having it be "just CSS" is a huge win, though. Entire collections of themes could be built by mostly writing new CSS files for standardized
components.

**Advantages**

- Small learning curve
- Wealth of documentation because it's CSS
- Solves issues with global namespacing
- Built into Gatsby

**Disadvantages**

- Multiple files are required (but less of an issue with file colocation), makes component shadowing more cumbersome
- Theming is more difficult and styling can quickly become inconsistent without rigorous code reviews or tooling
- Composition of rulesets is handled in CSS
- Class name dance is clunky
- Doesn't lend itself well to a WYSIWYG

## CSS in JS

CSS in JS is a controversial topic in web development, and for good reason, too. It's radically changed the way folks think about styling
and removes some of the less desirable parts of CSS via tooling.

I'm not going to go into defining what CSS in JS is since there are plenty of resources out there that do that. I'll be focusing on what it's
implications are for theming websites and apps.

In a lot of ways CSS in JS is a better fit for React's compositional model since it abstracts away the `<style>` tag and class name. This
abstraction allows theme authors a lot of protection because suddenly styling concerns are no longer global, and they're colocated to
the component they target. This is a substantial improvement in the developer experience.

This does come at a cost, a significant learning cost. Though, when thinking about the different approaches for styling it seems like it'd
be worth it.

**Advantages**

- Single file for component and its styles
- [Style composition is predictable](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/composition-of-styles-strings-vs-objects) with objects
- Automatically extract critical CSS
- No global namespace solution
- Built in (dynamic) theming, but low-level
- No more naming
- Tooling has matured

**Disadvantages**

- New toolchain to learn
- Performance can be an issue
- Media queries are difficult to work with
- Typically requires a plugin

CSS in JS does come in a few flavors, so I think it's worthwhile to break down the different usages and APIs.

### The `styled` tag

[styled-components](https://styled-components.com) is undoubtedly the library that popularized CSS in JS, and more specifically the
string template literal syntax. This made folks feel at home and begin adopting CSS in JS. Not to mention the colocation of styles
is _amazing_.

If you're unfamiliar with the styled component approach, it looks something like this:

```js
const Button = styled.Button`
  appearance: button;
  border: 0;
  outline: 0;
  borderradius: 4px;
  backgroundcolor: tomato;
  fontsize: 18px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
`
```

It works nicely for you primary components, and building out a component library of primitives. However, it starts to break down
when using it in larger, composite components.

What you end up having to do is name a component that will potentially only be used one time in the primary component of a file.
So you end up with a handful of component definitions at the top of a file that are only used once in the main export. Not to mention
you're left with an unnecessary abstraction away from the component.

[Chris Biscardi explains this well in his Styles and Naming post](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/styles-and-naming#when-to-name-components).

**Advantages**

- All the benefits of CSS in JS
- Feels natural to folks that are used to writing CSS

**Disadvantages**

- Difficult to treeshake (if even possible)
- Not very idiomatic JS
- Requires naming things
- Hides the HTML tag
- Handling props as a function for styles is clunky

### CSS prop

When you're building components for a website it's important to have an escape hatch for one-off needs. In traditional CSS this
often results in it's "append-only" characteristics which balloon over time. The `css` prop is a great way to achieve quick styling
needs without having to define components or tuck away the HTML element.

```js
<h1
  css={{
    color: 'tomato',
    margin: 0
  }}
/>
```

With CSS in JS, you can attach this bespoke styling need directly to your component. This colocation is powerful and
[deletable](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to).

## Theming

For Gatsby Themes we essentially have two layers of the same word: "Themes". Firstly there's the Gatsby Theme you `yarn add`. But, we
also have the notion of theme context which is used in CSS in JS libraries. This is the `ThemeProvider` which most CSS in JS libraries
expose in order to access design tokens in your CSS in JS.

React Context is a very powerful concept and CSS in JS is able to leverage that. Additionally, considering that Gatsby Themes will also
be composable this paradigm lends itself well for future theme interoperability.

One thing to look out for, though, is context clashing. So themes likely want to avoid Gatsby's `wrapRootElement` so that themes aren't
globally overriding context that other Gatsby Themes might depend on.

Though, the usage of `ThemeProvider`s will be extremely important to building out a robust collection of themes that are readily configurable.
After all, the ideal usage of a Gatsby Theme will be:

- I like that blog theme, `yarn add gatsby-theme-blog-dark`
- I want the change the primary color to tomato: `export default { ...theme, primary: 'tomato' }`

## Styled system

With [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) functional CSS benefits come to light while being able to
use a more React-like API. Components become a "bag of props" again without some of the clunky aspects of
class name handling since CSS in JS libraries abstract that away.

A standardized set of primitive components that serve as shared building blocks can help steer towards
consistency and ensure that themes can be adjusted via design system token changes. Being able to adjust
a JS object to instantly change aspects of a theme like color, type scale, and spacing will blow people's
minds.

### Styling as a function

Styled system helps push towards the pit of success by promoting "styling as a function". In a nutshell,
this means that your styling is a function of props and theme.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { space, color } from 'styled-system'

const Drawer = styled.nav(
  props => {
    width: props.state === 'expanded' ? 300 : 30
  },
  space,
  color
)
```

Similarly to how we can think of `fontSize` as a function of props and theme in styled system, we can also
think of style as a function of props and theme that return a collection of properties.

We can revisit the functional CSS example from above and express it even more powerfully:

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { space } from 'styled-system'

const doneStyles = {
  opacity: 80,
  backgroundColor: 'gray',
  fontWeight: 'normal'
}

const importantStyles = {
  backgroundColor: 'tomato'
}

export const ListItem = styled.li(
  props => props.variant === 'done' && doneStyles,
  props =>
    props.priority === 'high' && {
      backgroundColor: 'tomato'
    },
  space
)

ListItem.defaultProps = {
  padding: 3,
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  borderBottom: 'thin solid',
  borderColor: 'grays.8'
}
```

It's still early for large adoption of the styled system approach, but it's being adopted by organization
like GitHub's Primer and Material UI has their own alpha "system" component. As Tachyons and Tailwind see
large adoption it does seem like the wider community is warming up to these constrained, design system-based
approaches.

The one thing to be cognizant of is that styled-system components aren't really the best for content-heavy
sites, and when combined with the MDXProvider we end up with a lot of:

```js
<MDXProvider
  components={{
    h1: props => <h1 fontSize={[3, 4, 4]} {...props} />,
    h2: props => <h2 fontSize={2} {...props} />
    // ...
  }}
/>
```

This approach adds a lot of friction when you want to trivially change an h1. Now you're forced to write a
function/component rather than editing a JS object (which would be more preferable here).

**Advantages**

- Theming is first class
- Media queries are great to work with
- Lends itself nicely for a WYSIWYG
- Documentation can be generated
- Consistent and intuitive props API for all primitive components

**Disadvantages**

- Another tool to learn in addition to CSS in JS
- Better for app UI than content
- Can be clunky with the provider pattern like the MDXProvider

## Typography.js

One popular option for theming that provides a wonderfully small API to generate most other values in a design system
is [Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/).

A lot of Gatsby sites, and the sites in general, are content rich. This refers to blog posts, news articles, comments,
etc. This is also where styled system begins to be a bit clunky. With styled-system you have to manually tune all the
knobs and dials that are typically typography focused. This is where a
[typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) API really shines especially when
it comes to having themes that are an install away.

An interesting place to explore is how these to concepts can be merged for a holistic UI paradigm that encompasses things
like building layout and a footer while also ensuring typographic harmony for HTML output from Markdown.

**Advantages**

- Great for content-heaving sites
- Theming is first class
- Lends itself nicely for a WYSIWYG
- Documentation can be generated

**Disadvantages**

- Global CSS-based

## Typography System

Brent Jackson has built a [working prototype](https://github.com/jxnblk/typography-system) with this idea that
blends the styled-system theme object with typography.js. The best of both worlds!

Usage can look something like:

```js
// src/components/layout.js
import React from 'react'
import { TypographyProvider } from 'typography-system'

import theme from '../theme'

export default ({ children }) => (
  <TypographyProvider theme={theme}>{children}</TypographyProvider>
)
```

The TypographyProvider uses the theme context and Typography.js config to

### Component provider

MDX introduced a new concept, [Presentational Context](https://johno.com/presentational-context),
that uses a component provider to specify which components should be rendered for given
elements in a string of content. I think this will be something interesting to explore as well for styling other types
of long form content. In addition to providing the theme, the TypographyProvider could hypothetically provide the
components to be rendered for the long form content based on typography.js.

Down the road, this could even allow for theme authors to turn on/off the global styles that typography.js creates because
the relevant components will be provided with the styling built in.

## Design tokens

No matter which route we take, we will need to use "design tokens" which a theme will leverage. This will make it simpler for
theme users to tweak things like colors and scales. These can also map to "styles" for things like layout
(container width, margin, etc).

### Component shadowing

Gatsby themes allow for component shadowing which is an interesting way to achieve theme changing. This means you can
do something like create an empty object for `src/theme.js`, which is then pulled in to extend tokens.

In practice, this looks like the working example
[jlengstorf/theme-abstraction-idea](https://github.com/jlengstorf/theme-abstraction-idea/blob/master/packages/gatsby-theme-stylish-docs/src/tokens/index.js)):

```
- src/
  |- tokens/
  |  |- colors.js
  |  \- index.js
  \- theme.js
```

In the tokens files, we export objects for the tokens:

```js
// src/tokens/colors.js
export default {
  black: '#121212',
  primary: 'rebeccapurple',
  white: 'white'
}
```

In `src/theme.js`, we default to an empty object:

```js
// src/theme.js
export default {}
```

We use these values to extend the default tokens:

```js
// src/tokens/index.js
import colors from './colors'
import theme from '../theme'

export const colors = { ...colors, ...(theme.colors || {}) }
```

This is extra boilerplate on the theme side, but the ergonomics for extending the theme are really good. In the site that's using
the theme (or child theme), you only have to eject the specific values you want to override instead of the entire tokens file:

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-mytheme/theme.js
export default {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato'
  }
}
```

Each token group can be targeted with a prop matching its name, and individual values are overridden by redeclaring them in that object.
All other values from the theme are kept intact, which makes e.g. later updates easier for theme consumers.

**Advantages**

- Better ergonomics for theme consumers
- Easier upgrade path for theme consumers
- Guarantee that required values are set (unless the theme consumer _explicitly_ chooses to break the theme)
- Boilerplate can potentially be packaged up in a utility function for better DX/consistency

**Disadvantages**

- Requires extra boilerplate
- "Tokens" is a vague term, but we can consider something like "styles"

## Config-driven theme object

I've been struggling with the usage of component shadowing for the global theme. It's a powerful API and will
make Gatsby Themes infinitely customizable for users. However, I'm not sure it's the perfect API for something
that's intended to be customized so readily. Theme authors will want to expose an API for making styling changes
right off the bat for things like typography and brand colors.

I'm a bit skeptical using component shadow as an API for things that will always be changed, like design token
values and author names/bios/etc.

An idea we're exploring is a theme plugin that can source a theme object and expose it via context. This could
also allow themes to bring their defaults which can be overridden and merged with the user's `theme.js`. It
could go as far as adding it to Gatsby's [data layer](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-four/).

This would allow you to use [StaticQuery](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-query/) to set context via
[`wrapRootElement`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-01-31-using-react-context-api-with-gatsby/#modifying-the-gatsby-browser-file)
or even only for _particular pages_ that are created programmatically.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { useTheme } from 'some-library'
import { TypographyProvider } from 'typography-system'

export default ({ children }) => {
  const theme = useTheme() // Light wrapper around useStaticQuery

  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>
}
```

Then, Gatsby Themes could wrap this all up internally, allowing for a powerful end user API and even a UI for
theme customization that can output the proper `theme.js` file.

### Standardizing a data shape

The data layer would only allow for key/value pairs, but I think this is a good constraint that can cover 95% of
use cases. We can standardize the theme shape for theme authors that want to opt in. This allows the theme object to be
predictable and interchangeable.

We've been exploring a blending of typography.js and styled-system called typography-system (now Theme UI) which we can use
to define that structure. Both configurations bring a lot to the table. Typography.js allows for a more
abstract representation of typography that lends itself nicely to content heavy sites while styled-system
allows you to specify scales and other styling config that will help to drive 95% of your UI.

#### System UI

It's safe to say that no matter what approach is taken, [interoperability](https://jxnblk.com/blog/interoperability/)
is important. This is why Brent Jackson has proposed a [Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme).

> Where I see differences start to arise is at the theme definition level. Even outside of React context-based theming,
> a lot of React applications will store global style constants in a common module. Something I'm starting to notice is
> that there are no standard conventions for what that module contains or how its structured, but all of them seem to be
> doing the same thing, in a slightly different way.
>
> — [Brent Jackson](https://twitter.com/jxnblk) in _[Interoperability](https://jxnblk.com/blog/interoperability/)_

It's important that whatever approach we go with uses a standard format, so it makes sense that the data shape follows
along with the System UI Theme Specification.

##### Transformers

Having a standard spec will also allow for building transformers to support different configuration shapes that might
exist in the wild for things like Typography.js, Tachyons, Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc. This is important because it can
allow for incremental adoption with direct usage in more greenfield projects.

## Extending components and themes

We don't have any usage data yet, but it's reasonable to expect scenarios where a theme user will want to adjust the
color of an avatar border and add more horizontal padding. If a component has a styled-system API it could be quickly
achieved with extension and component shadowing:

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-awesome/avatar.js
import { Avatar } from 'gatsby-theme-awesome'

export default props => <Avatar {...props} borderColor="tomato" py={4} />
```

This extension model can be useful for mixing in new styling with composition:

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-awesome/avatar.js
import { Avatar, Card } from 'gatsby-theme-awesome'

export default props => (
  <Card boxShadow="large" margin={3}>
    <Avatar {...props} borderColor="tomato" paddingHorizontal={4} />
  </Card>
)
```

It can even be used with CSS in JS "extend" APIS:

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-awesome/avatar.js
import styled from 'library'
import { Avatar } from 'gatsby-theme-awesome'

export default styled(Avatar)({ backgroundColor: 'tomato' })
```

Of course this can also be achieved through CSS. But similarly to how React has become a function of data that outputs UI,
I like to think of styling as a function of props and theme that output a style object.

**Advantages**

- Less need for theme style configs that handle everything (like avatarBackgroundColor)

**Disadvantages**

- Could be heavy handed for building a collection of themes with different styles
- Might be better handled as config

## Theme UI

I'd left off this analysis here as we began working on experimenting on what the best
combination of all this might look like.

Then, as always, Brent Jackson built the thing that, in my opinion, connected all the dots.

I won't go into a ton of detail now, since the [Theme UI docs](https://theme-ui.com/)
already do a great job explaining the rationale and benefits. Though, I will briefly summarize
them here.

- **Compatible with Typography.js** This is important due to the solid API and the precedence
  it has set in the Gatsby ecosystem.
- **Styled System aware from theme config** This removes a point of friction when using your
  design system components with MDX when you want to style content elements but not write JSX.
- **SX prop** Get the benefits of the CSS prop while constraining to your design system
- **Color modes** Modern websites and apps are taking things to the next level by allowing
  users to customize their experience (light/darkmodes). This is built in.

### SX prop

Going along with the main benefits we see from the CSS prop above, Theme UI introduces
the [`sx` prop](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop). What's great about this approach is it still
allows for a lightweight abstraction _and_ the ability to directly hook into theme values which
helps ensure that websites and apps remain consistent and adhere to a design system.

To me, it's a worthwhile bit of magic, too. Having to combine the CSS prop with some type of
theme-aware function was a lot of boilerplate considering how frequently it'd be used.

**Before**

```js
<h1
  css={css({
    color: 'text',
    backgroundColor: 'background',
    m: 0,
    pt: 3
  })}
/>
```

**After**

```js
<h1
  sx={{
    color: 'text',
    backgroundColor: 'background',
    m: 0,
    pt: 3
  }}
/>
```

## What's next?

I'm excited about the tooling we can build to make Theme UI better integrate with building
things with Gatsby and the greater ecosystem as a whole. WYSIWYGs for theme editing, more
layout handling, and even full-fledged UI libraries.

Static analysis is another interesting thing, and is something we could build into Gatsby.
For usages of CSS in JS and Theme UI that don't need a runtime features we could extract into
static CSS (potentially even functional CSS so it's more human readable). Inspiration for this
approach would be [linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria).

## Conclusion

I'm very excited about what Theme UI brings to the table. There's definitely some magic there,
but we're working on improving documentation and the tooling to make things less of a jump.

It was very apparent that CSS in JS was required, and we wanted to use Emotion/MDX/styled-system
at the core. We wanted to avoid the `styled` tag in favor of the CSS prop.

Using CSS in JS is required because the web platform simply isn't there yet. Working on top
of the web platform, in userland like CSS in JS does, is required while it catches up. When
things become natively supported we can remove userland implementations, often times without
even breaking changes. By the way, this isn't a slight at the web platform. It understandably
has to move slower to ensure backwards compatibility and vet new technology and approaches.
After all, it's the most used platform in the world.

I'm not yet holding my breath for JSX being natively supported, but I'm pretty confident on
it happening at some point.

## A quick aside

The cool part, in the context of Gatsby Themes, is that the community can build themes with any tool that they'd like.
So, if that means a whole suite of themes using Sass, that's also a possibility! For officially supported themes we
want to make sure they're forward-looking, customizable, and avoid common issues like CSS selector clashing or
complex configuration.
