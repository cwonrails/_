When building Gatsby Themes it's becoming common to use a yarn
workspace that contains themes and their related starters. This
workflow is great because you can build your theme as a package
while configuring it as the end user.

This lets you do something like:

```sh
yarn workspace gastby-starter-documentation develop
```

In this scenario we have a the following folder structure:

```
├── examples
│   └── gatsby-starter-documentation
│       ├── gatsby-config.js
│       ├── package.json
│       └── readme.md
├── package.json
├── packages
│   └── gatsby-theme-documentation
│       ├── gatsby-config.js
│       ├── gatsby-node.js
│       ├── index.js
│       ├── package.json
│       └── readme.md
└── readme.md
```

`packages/gatsby-theme-documentation` contains the theme
library and `examples/gatsby-starter-documentation` contains
the starter.

However, `gatsby new` only scaffolds out projects from a
single repo, monorepos aren't currently supported. This means
that you'll have to clone each example and push it to a
standalone repo. Luckily, you can automate that with a
GitHub Action!

I've created an action based on Gatsby's own tooling for
handling official starters: https://github.com/johno/actions-push-subdirectories

## Diving into the action itself

In its entirety, we can see the bash script. It's about 30 lines of code that sets
the folder and GitHub username, and then iterates over all directories inside the
given folder to:

- Determine the location of the git repo
- Pluck out the name of the starter in package.json
- Deletes all the old files
- Pulls in the new files from the source repo
- Updates the `yarn.lock`
- Pushes to the repo

```sh
#!/bin/bash
FOLDER=$1
GITHUB_USERNAME=$2
BASE=$(pwd)

git config --global user.email "johno-actions-push-subdirectories@example.org"
git config --global user.name "$GITHUB_USERNAME"

echo "Cloning folders in $FOLDER and pushing to $GITHUB_USERNAME"

# sync to read-only clones
for folder in $FOLDER/*; do
  [ -d "$folder" ] || continue # only directories
  cd $BASE

  echo "Pushing $folder"

  NAME=$(cat $folder/package.json | jq -r '.name')
  CLONE_DIR="__${NAME}__clone__"

  # clone, delete files in the clone, and copy (new) files over
  # this handles file deletions, additions, and changes seamlessly
  git clone --depth 1 https://$API_TOKEN_GITHUB@github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/$NAME.git $CLONE_DIR
  cd $CLONE_DIR
  find . | grep -v ".git" | grep -v "^\.*$" | xargs rm -rf # delete all files (to handle deletions in monorepo)
  cp -r $BASE/$folder/. .

  rm -rf yarn.lock
  yarn

  git add .
  git commit --message "Update $NAME from $GITHUB_REPOSITORY"
  git push origin master

  cd $BASE
done
```

## Using the action

Using `actions-push-subdirectories` we can create a workflow
that first checks to make sure a commit landed on master, and
if it has, it will then push the latest in `examples/gatsby-starter-documentation`
to `johno/gatsby-starter-documentation`.

First, we can use the built-in git filter to only run
the rest of the workflow when a commit hits the
master branch. Then, we'll set up a basic node
environment.

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  master:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '10.x'
```

Then we need to use `johno/actions-push-subdirectories`. Note
that you'll need to specify args for both the directory of examples
and the GitHub username. And of course, set an `API_TOKEN_GITHUB`
key that has permissions to write to your repos.

```
- name: publish:starters
  uses: johno/actions-push-subdirectories@master
  env:
      API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB }}
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  with:
    args: examples johno
```

All together:

```
name: Publish Starters

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  master:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '10.x'
      - name: publish:starters
        uses: johno/actions-push-subdirectories@master
        env:
            API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB }}
            GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: examples johno
```

## Conclusion

Using a GitHub Action to publish read only starters from a
monorepo is a rad way to automate working with the existing
Gatsby project scaffold tooling.
