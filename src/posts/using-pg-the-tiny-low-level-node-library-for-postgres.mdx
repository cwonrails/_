[`pg`](https://node-postgres.com/) or, node-postgres is a delightful
little library for working with PostgreSQL databases.

**Note:** If you're working with user input I recommend going
with a full-fledged ORM, otherwise you might open yourself up
to SQL Injection.

## Installing

```sh
yarn add pg dotenv
```

## Create a .env file

```sh
PGUSER=postgres
PGDATABASE=test
PGPASSWORD=password
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
```

## Initialize the client with env

```js
require('dotenv').configure()
const { Client } = require('pg')

const client = new Client()
```

## Create a table

```js
await client.query(`
  CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";

  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS colors (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(256) UNIQUE,
    hex VARCHAR(256) UNIQUE
  );
`)
```

## Insert into the table

```js
const query = {
  text: 'INSERT INTO colors(name, hex) VALUES($1, $2)',
  values: ['tomato', '#ff6347'],
}

await client.query(query)
```

### Insert objects

This is a bit of a hack, but useful for one-off scripts.

```js
const color = {
  name: 'tomato',
  hex: '#ff6347'
}

const query = {
  text: `
    INSERT INTO statsReadings(${Object.keys(color).join(', ')})
    VALUES(${Object.keys(color).map((_, i) => `\$${i + 1}`)})
    `,
  values: Object.values(color),
}

await client.query(query)
```

### Query values

```js
const { rows } = await client.query(`
  SELECT id, name, hex FROM colors
`)
```

## Conclusion

As I noted before, this is not a library you want to use if
you're working with user input because higher-level ORMs handle
important aspects like escaping.

However, for read only databases and backend scraping/storage it's
nice to use because it doesn't hide away the SQL in an API. It's
also pretty fast, too. One might even say blazing fast.
