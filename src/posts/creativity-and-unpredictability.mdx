A collection of thoughts and notes when reading along with
[Creativity and Unpredictability](https://web.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/boden.html)
by Margaret Boden.

In this article Margaret explores "creativity" and "unpredictability" as creatives and
scientists look for "surprise" and "awe".

## Combinations

> People of a scientific cast of mind often try to define creativity in terms of "novel
> combinations of old ideas." In that case, the surprise caused by a creative idea must
> be due to the improbability of the combination, and purely statistical tests (as used
> by some experimental psychologists) could identify creativity. Creativity, in this view,
> just is unpredictability.

This reminds me a bit of the meme "radio, but on the internet". As Margaret later states,
these combinations will often fail to justify or explain why it's creative or valuable.

Many creations, innovations, and discoveries have used this combination method, so it's
undoubtedly a justified approach.

## Creative novelties

> Many creative ideas are surprising not because they involve some unusual mix of familiar
> ideas, but in a deeper way. They concern novel ideas which not only did not happen before,
> but which--in a sense that must be made clear (and which combination-theory cannot
> express)--could not have happened before.

Margaret then goes into a comparison with language, which itself as an infinite collection
of permutations that are grammatically correct. Native speakers can quickly determine which
are proper and which aren't, too. Language itself is a computational problem in creativity.
It's typically based on "first-time novelty rather than radical originality".

> A merely novel idea is one which can be described and/or produced by the same (specified)
> set of generative rules as are other, familiar ideas. A genuinely original, or creative,
> idea is one which cannot.

This is so interesting to me, particularly in terms of [Components AI](https://components.ai).
I've argued before that design is essentially a computational problem much like language.
After all, they are so intrinsically related. **For most folks, the needs for web design
are a tractable subset of components and skin.**

There are a finite set of rules which can be used to compute any number of permutations,
much like language.

**I think most importantly, when the easily computable starts being computed, the doors
for creativity are opened.**

This does fail to address something more interesting to me, though. Sometimes design boils
down the the **intentional violation of rules in design**. It's a harder consideration
because it often requires substantial training to know _when_ it's acceptable to violate
these rules for the sake of creativity.

Going back to the concept of language, the notion of violating rules for the sake of
creativity is interesting. Whether intentional or not, it can be a statement to
intentionally violate grammar.

Split infinitives. Fuck!

## Rules and constraints define computational boundaries

Margaret brings up some interesting points when she refers to different disciplines and
how the define a style of thinking. She mentions sonata form, chess, tonal harmony, pointillism,
sonnets, limericks, aromatic chemistry, and the Thirty-Nine Articles.

Each of these disciplines have rules that determine creative boundaries, though some have
much larger ranges than others. These are constraints.

Margaret goes on to state that these disciplines dictate that a "'deeply' creative idea is
not just improbable, but impossible". I might be misunderstanding this point, or she will
revisit it momentarily, but there seems to be more than sufficient room for genuinely creative
things.

Tonal Harmony, popularized in post-Renaissance Western music, is an example that shows a
finite space will eventually be computed. Pieces always began and ended with a "home key"
which constrained the possible space for notes.

Eventually some of the rules are undermined, and then formally broken to allow for more
creative expression.

## Is it a notch or a niche?

Margaret states that exploring an unknown niche in a pre-existing conceptual space isn't
something regarded as comparably creative to radically transforming an existing space.
That reasoning seems sound because exploration has fewer rules, there's more gray area,
and there's less convention and group think turning a transformative idea into a swim
upriver.

> To explore a space and locate within it a substantial sub-space, an environmental niche for a
> range of previously unsuspected ideas, is to do more than find "some quirky little two-line
> proof." That phrase suggests a notch, not a niche.

What exactly a true transformation can be difficult to define, and sometimes requires
the vantage of history to make it obvious.

## The hunch

I read somewhere that "great ideas fade into view" (I think How to Take Smart Notes), and
I think the hunch is related to that. When researching in an area for long enough, your
hunch fades into view, even if it might be realized as an "epiphany".

## Scientifically understanding creativity

Margaret revisits what I pondered before nearly right away. The "impossible" creativity
isn't meant to refer to something that's _actually_ impossible, but creations that are
_seemingly_ impossible.

Using computation and the assistance of AI, we can map out spaces substantially more
efficiently than using the human mind alone. Even if these programs aren't studies in
creativity, they do benefit it.

> The more clearly we can map this space, the more confidently we can identify and ask
> questions about the creativity involved in negotiating it.

In addition to mapping the space, I think there's value here because we're _augmenting_
creativity.

There are mentions of the Automatic Mathemetician (AM) and EURISKO that are computer
models for creativity in math. These models can have hunches, introduce new concepts
that are surprising to researchers, and EURISKO can even change its own heuristics.

Genetic algorithms are self mutating algorithms as they evolve over time. Traits and
characterstics can "crossover" in unpredictable ways.

This has interesting applications when fitness functions are configurable by end users
of a program. In some ways it further enables exploration and thus creativity.

## Undpredictability

Ultimately, I guess "impossible" creativity is what's unpredictable, particularly when
in combination with AI that can change its own heuristics. Though **I think we can
also increase unpredictability by making rule violation in computational models
configurable. This unpredictability leads to serendipity.**

Entropy on a slider.

It's fascinating to me to read about a profound analysis of serendipity and creativity
from 1995 because it's been a key motivation for my work with computational/generative
design. In addition to making design/development workflows more efficient, I want to
bring back in the "serendipity".

## Conclusion

This was a rad read, and as one can see, really got me thinking by my abnormally
long collection of notes and stream of consciousness tangents.
