When the yarn package manager was released, I was one
of the holdouts that stuck with npm for a long time.
Originally, I thought the npm team felt like the perfect
underdog story with a solid, diverse team. I didn't see
the reason to switch to "yet another Facebook project".

I did _really_ appreciate the fire it lit under npm's
bottom though. The npm CLI shipping definitely got much
quicker for a while after yarn's release.

## Why I was a hold out

In addition to being yet another Facebook project, I was
reluctant to change because there were certain things that
I wasn't keen on.

- I didn't like that the commands subtly changed
- I'm very critical of changing important parts of my workflow

## Considerations always on my mind

npm being a VC funded company that was shipped as part of
node was always precarious. It became even more so when
innovation stagnated and it became apparent it was no
longer a "nice people matter" type of company.

So, I somehow, began to trust Facebook more (WTF?).

## When my opinion began to change

However, after many years building packages in the node
ecosystem, I began to find it tiresome to manage many
packages amongst many repos. There's often an obvious
boundary for packages though their development is
interrelated.

This was around the time the monorepo began to gain a
lot of popularity in open source.

After some experimentation, that's when I fell in love
with the workspace. yarn nailed this.

As soon as the yarn workspace became an integral part
of my workflow I couldn't look back. Not to mention,
having to remember two different CLIs based on whether
I was working with a workspace or not was too much
overhead.

## Why did I fall in love with yarn workspaces?

This really boils down to two reasons. First, when I
needed to debug two libraries together, I began using
the yarn workspace workflow. I'd often clone both
projects into a single project and then create a
"consuming" package which I interlinked as a yarn
workspace.

This was super powerful.

The other reason that really solidified yarn for me was
working with Gatsby Themes. It ultimately made the most
sense for the theme author workflow to use yarn workspaces
since they'd have to manage one or more packages _in
addition to_ a consuming starter.

## There was another thing, too

One other motivation was the fact that yarn-based projects
simply worked better with yarn. A handful of large frameworks
and libraries would work with `yarn install` but wouldn't
with `npm install`. This was a frustration with my workflow
and it helped me gradually gain trust in yarn.

So, I caved. Over time some key features became to powerful
of a gravitational pull:

- workspaces
- reproducible installs
- solid caching
- fast
- resilient to network issues
- resolutions

## Conclusion

I'm all in on yarn these days. What won me over was the
yarn workspace. I stuck around for speed, caching, and
the yarn.lock.
