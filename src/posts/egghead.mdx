I'm pretty excited that I've [begun teaching on egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/john-otander).

It's been a long time coming, and over time Joel has
helped to show me that I have content to offer that can
help folks out as they navigate this wild world we call
software development.

I've noticed that there's already lots of great introductory
content out there for web development, but there seems to
be quite a void for stuff that's a bit more advanced.

Most days I'm working on whacky stuff like unified and babel
plugins or establishing Gatsby theme conventions with projects
like Theme UI. This is where I'll focus my first collections of
lessons.

In the long term I'd really like to go in-depth around parsers,
compilers, and ASTs since they're a greate way to learn
"computer science-y" concepts that have applications in
day to day work. My experience building MDX and working on
unified gives me some fresh perspective, too. My working
name for this project is "Compilers for Humans".

I've been impressed with how helpful the entire egghead
team is, too. I'm not one to typically put myself out there
and do things like screencasting so they've been great
on making sure my lessons adhere to the "egghead style".
