import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

The `useEffect` hook from React allows you to create side
effects in your components. This can combine nicely with
MDX because you can do a wide array of things including
fetching data from the client and even updating
your title.

```mdx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

# Let's fetch some data and display it!

export const PokemonData = () => {
  const [pokemon, setPokemon] = useState(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchPokemon = () => {
      fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/')
        .then((result) => result.json())
        .then((data) => setPokemon(data))
    }
    fetchPokemon()
  }, [])
  if (!pokemon) {
    return <h1>Fetching pokemon...</h1>
  }
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(pokemon, null, 2)}</pre>
}

<PokemonData />
```

**Note**: It's important that you don't include any
empty lines in the code block since there's currently
a [parsing bug](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/195)
that will hopefully be addressed in v2.

That's it. Here's the exact code in the code block copied
over into the very MDX file I wrote this post with:

export const PokemonData = () => {
  const [pokemon, setPokemon] = useState(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchPokemon = () => {
      fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/')
        .then((result) => result.json())
        .then((data) => setPokemon(data))
    }
    fetchPokemon()
  }, [])
  if (!pokemon) {
    return <h1>Fetching pokemon...</h1>
  }
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(pokemon, null, 2)}</pre>
}

<div style={{ maxHeight: '24em', overflowY: 'scroll' }}>
  <PokemonData />
</div>
