In MDX, components can be seamlessly imported and rendered, which
means you can wrap native web components in React and render them
to an MDX document.

It's important to note that [React and web components aren't 100% compatible](https://reactjs.org/docs/web-components.html),
but this will get you most of the way.

Firstly, you can create a web component that's wrapped with a
React component. The important piece is the `useRef` from React
so that we can get a reference to the web component when it's
mounted. This allows us to call its increment method.

```js
import React, { useRef } from 'react'

class Counter extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })
    this.currentCount = 0
    this.update()
  }

  update() {
    this.shadow.innerHTML = `<div><h2>Count: ${this.currentCount}</h2></div>`
  }

  increment() {
    this.currentCount++
    this.update()
  }
}

window.customElements.define('i-counter', Counter)

export const RenderCounter = () => {
  const counterElement = useRef(null)
  return (
    <div>
      <i-counter ref={counterElement}></i-counter>
      <button onClick={() => counterElement.current.increment()}>
        Click me!
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default () => <RenderCounter />
```

Now that we have a web component wrapped in a React component
we can use it directly in an MDX file.

```mdx
import WebComponent from './web-component'

# Here's a web component wrapped with React in MDX!

<WebComponent />
```

Web components aren't always a great fit when you're already
working in React, but if you have a bespoke need to render
a web component this is how you'd achieve it.
