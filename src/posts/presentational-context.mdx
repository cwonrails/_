MDX helped popularize placing components in context and using
them it to control the presentation of child components. At the time,
it seemed like a need unique MDX. It made sense to declare
your component mapping for Markdown elements in one place
(your layout) so that all MDX documents will know what component
to render.

Then, we began to see more potential usages for libraries like
[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) and [Blocks](https://mdx-blocks.com).
Now it's a UI pattern so it's time to coin it.

> When you encounter an h1 in MDX, render MyH1 instead.

This avoids needing to use global, or scoped, CSS styles to
target MDX documents and even allows users to layer in more
complex components like a REPL.

This is Presentational Context.

## Why?

The Presentational Context approach is powerful because **it allows
parent context to control rendering at any level of its tree**.

> â€” [ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ¶ Spicy Mark Dalgleish meme](https://mobile.twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/1148695292381806592)

It's akin to the following CSS (contextual styling):

```css
.header h1 {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

But it's a bit more nuanced.

With context you control more than the styling. You control the
DOM output, you control its functionality. This allows you to layer
in interactivity. It even allows you to swap out `h1`s for `h2`s in
nested documents to ensure proper semantic markup hierarchies.

## Composition

An added benefit of this approach is that you can compose
your presentational components throughout a single tree.

```js
// src/pages/some-page.js
// ...
export default () => (
  <MDXProvider components={components}>
    <SomeMDXDocument />
    <AnotherMDXDocument />
    <MDXProvider components={faqComponents}>
      <FaqMDXDocument />
    </MDXProvider>
  </MDXProvider>
)
```

This is the cascade that Mark Dalgleish is referring to. This allows
you to target the presentation of components at the document level
by composing providers and documents together.

### Opting out

Adopting a pattern found in [styled-components](https://styled-components.com)
and [emotion](https://emotion.sh) you can allow for a function to be passed
to the provider. It will receive the outer context's components which can
be used to customize the merge and even drop the outer components entirely.

##### Merging in an `h1` from outer context:

```js
// src/pages/some-page.js
// ...
export default () => (
  <MDXProvider components={components}>
    <SomeMDXDocument />
    <MDXProvider components={({ h1 }) => { ...faqComponents, h1}}>
      <FaqMDXDocument />
    </MDXProvider>
  </MDXProvider>
)
```

##### Dropping all outer context components

```js
// src/pages/some-page.js
// ...
export default () => (
  <MDXProvider components={components}>
    <SomeMDXDocument />
    <MDXProvider components={() => { ...faqComponents, h1}}>
      <FaqMDXDocument />
    </MDXProvider>
  </MDXProvider>
)
```

This provides a lot of control for users by leveraging composition
without a lot of cognitive overhead.

## How does it work?

For this example, let's dive into how the
[MDXProvider](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#mdxprovider)
works. MDXProvider is essentially
[vanilla React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

It receives an object of components that might look like:

```js
{
  h1: props => <h1 {...props} color="tomato" />,
  blockquote: BlockQuote,
  code: PrismCodeBlock
}
```

It then merges that object with any outer context components
and adds that entire object to context. Below is _nearly_ the
entirety for the official MDXProvider's implementation:

```js
import React from 'react'

const MDXContext = React.createContext({})

export const withMDXComponents = Component => props => {
  const allComponents = useMDXComponents(props.components)

  return <Component {...props} components={allComponents} />
}

export const useMDXComponents = (components = {}) => {
  const contextComponents = React.useContext(MDXContext)

  return { ...contextComponents, ...components }
}

export const MDXProvider = props => {
  const allComponents = useMDXComponents(props.components)

  return (
    <MDXContext.Provider value={allComponents}>
      {props.children}
    </MDXContext.Provider>
  )
}

export default MDXContext
```

Thanks to React hooks, any other component can now pull
in these components with `const components = useMDXComponents()`.
Pretty rad.

### Rendering with context

The render step of MDX is a bit more complex because it uses
a [custom pragma](https://mdxjs.com/blog/custom-pragma/), but in
essence it works by tapping into context when an h1 is encountered
and renders the h1 component if it exists.

```js
// src/components/renderer.js
export default ({ tagName, ...props }) => {
  const components = useMDXComponents()
  const component = components[tagName] || tagName

  return React.createElement(component, props)
}
```

Using the component:

```js
<Renderer tagName="h1">Hello, world!</Renderer>
```

## Does it scale?

So far we have found that it does, and have yet to see evidence to the
contrary. In some circumstances it can result in smaller SSR-ed documents
because **prism output can sometimes 10x DOM output when rendered to markup**.
Granted, a smaller DOM output is most beneficial after rehydration, but
that's a fine tradeoff for content-heavy sites with multi-page visits.

## The future

A valid drawback of this approach is the fact that sometime computation
heavy components are brought into the runtime (like syntax highlighting)
which can add bloat to the page.

However, that's something we can address more intelligently at build time.
This isn't yet something supported by any frameworks (that I know of), but
during the SSR step we could perform static analysis on MDX syntax, like a
code block that can either be syntax highlighted _or_ a REPL, and render
different components.

### Bundle splitting shortcodes

Current implementations bundle all components passed to the MDXProvider which
can include [shortcodes](https://mdxjs.com/blog/shortcodes/). We can take the
static analysis even farther by determining which components are used in which
document, and only bundle those for a particular page.

## Conclusion

Using context to handle presentational components can be a powerful pattern.
It's something I've found to be more idiomatic React for MDX's use case and
it feels pretty nice in [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) as well.
