When creating a new repo that comes from code in an existing
repository, it's useful to maintain the git history when possible
because it serves as additional documentation and context. It
also ensures the original author of the code is credited!

Here's how you can achieve it in a few commands.O

**Create your new repo**

```sh
mkdir new-repo
```

**Clone the source repo**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/johno/a-repo
```

**Filter all commits aside from the directory you care about in the source repo**

```sh
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter my-dir -- -- all
```

\*\*Add a "local remote" to the source repository"

```sh
git remote add source-repo ../a-repo
```

**Then fetch the "local remote"**

```sh
git fetch source-repo
```

**Create a branch from the source's master**

```sh
git branch source-repo remotes/source-repo/master
```

**Then merge in the source repo**

```sh
git merge source-repo --allow-unrelated-histories
```

**Lastly, clean up the source repo**

```sh
git remote rm source-repo
git branch -d source-repo
```

**And commit**

```sh
git push origin master
```
