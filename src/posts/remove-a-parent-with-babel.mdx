When you're processing a JSX AST you might want to remove
a parent of a particular node. In this example we'll search
for a member expression based on its name and then remove
the assignment expression it's a part of.

```js
const foo = {}
foo.bar = 'baz' // Line we want to remove
```

First, you can create a member expression visitor that
will match the names:

```js
MemberExpression(path) {
  if (path.node.object.name !== 'foo') {
    return
  }
  if (path.node.property.name !== 'bar') {
    return
  }

  // We've found our member expression
}
```

Once we've found our member expression we can reference
the `parentPath` and call `remove` to remove the entire
parent node from the AST.

All together:

```js
export default () => {
  return {
    visitor: {
      MemberExpression(path) {
        if (path.node.object.name !== 'foo') {
          return
        }
        if (path.node.property.name !== 'bar') {
          return
        }

        path.parentPath.remove()
      }
    }
  }
}
```
