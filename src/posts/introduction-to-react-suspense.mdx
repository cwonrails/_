React Suspense is an (experimental) React primitive that tells React that a particular
component is still waiting on data. Generally speaking, a lot of React developers building
apps won’t typically interact with Suspense, it’ll be more common for building libraries
that help with data fetching. It’s sort of low-level, but allows for tight integrations
with React at the library/tool level.

One of the key benefits of React Suspense is the fact that it lets you render as you fetch.
Other common patterns pre-Suspense forced you to render the component and the kick off a fetch
in a `useEffect` hook. This is a bit clunky and results in a lot of layout thrashing as
information comes in and isn’t the best UX or DX.

Interestingly, we recently had to work with it directly for some features in Gatsby Recipes,
particularly in our custom react renderer. Though, we used the functionality for quite a
different usage than rendering to DOM. Throughout the building process of that functionality
I got to learn how to use Suspect, so let’s check out it out:

_Note: The [official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html)
[link a CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/frosty-hermann-bztrp)
that you can play with directly if you’re interested._

At its simplest the Suspense component sets up a boundary for data fetching that can suspend
while a request is happening. The way you get this to work is be throwing a promise which is a
pretty interesting API. Though, it makes sense because React will catch the promise and then
wait for it to resolve before attempting to re-render.

Here’s a short example:

```js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'

const pokemonResource = () => {
  const promise = fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/')
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .catch((e) => {
      return { error: true }
    })

  throw promise
}
const Pokemon = () => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading Pokemon...</h1>}>
      <PokemonList />
    </Suspense>
  )
}

const PokemonList = () => {
  const pokemon = pokemonResource()

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(pokemon, null, 2)}</pre>
}
```

There are two primary pieces that make this all work. Firstly, the Suspense component which
handles the catching of the promise we threw. The second important piece is the `pokemonResource`
which performs a fetch against the API and then throws that promise. We add in a `then` for the
happy path and a `catch` to the promise chain.

Those values, from the promise chain, are what the component eventually sees when the fetch
ends up resolving. So, there’s a bit of song and dance inside the resource to make Suspense
work (and also why this functionality is intended to be wrapped up by library authors).
But it isn’t _too_ magical.
