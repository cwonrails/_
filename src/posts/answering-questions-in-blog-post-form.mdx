In early 2019, I began a new workflow that has been paying off
in spades. So, I thought I'd share it.

With my day-to-day work, I'll often get questions from folks
on Slack, Twitter, etc. on problems with particular tech, how
to solve something, or even about my experiences so far in the
tech industry.

Wanting to be helpful to friends, colleagues, and aspiring
software engineers I found myself writing long, thoughtful
messages. This was rad because I think it at least provided
some information that was helpful, but then what I just wrote
was lost in the ephemerality of DMs or closed Slack communities.

So, I started answering some of the questions that are more
generally applicable in blog post form. This paid off because
no longer were the answers lost, but when I received the same
question again I was able to link directly to my previous
response.

Here and there, I'll even spend some time that I normally would
be retyping up an answer in my head on improving the blog post.

One of those questions I received frequently last year was about
[remote work](/remote-work), so I had written up a post. As the
concept catches on more and more, it's become increasingly invaluable
to be able to quickly link my personal "tips and tricks" that have
helped me throughout my remote work journey.

This workflow has been pretty helpful to me for what's a small
upfront investment. Worst case, you can copy and paste your
DM response into your editor and press publish.
