When you're processing a JSX AST, particularly for adding
in developer tooling, you might want to wrap JSX elements
so that you can compose additional functionality like hover
interaction, selection, etc.

For example we might have the following input:

```js
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

And we want the following output:

```js
<Wrapper>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</Wrapper>
```

To achieve this, we'll need to visit all `JSXElement` nodes,
if that node isn't a `Wrapper` and its parent isn't either,
we can wrap it.

All together:

```js
export default api => {
  const { types: t } = api

  const isWrapper = node => {
    return (
      t.isJSXElement(node) &&
      t.isJSXIdentifier(node.openingElement) &&
      node.openingElement.name.name === 'Wrapper'
    )
  }

  return {
    visitor: {
      JSXElement: {
        exit: path => {
          if (isWrapper(path.node) || isWrapper(path.parent)) {
            return
          }

          path.replaceWith(
            t.jsxElement(
              t.jsxOpeningElement(t.jsxIdentifier('Wrapper')),
              t.jsxClosingElement(t.jsxIdentifier('Wrapper')),
              [path.node]
            )
          )
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Checking the parent to make sure it's also not a wrapper might
seem strange, but this is required to make sure that we don't
end up recursively wrapping the same element. That would result
in an infinite loop.
