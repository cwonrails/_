The other day my friend sent a pretty random DM
during a conversation that really got me thinking.

> writing out 13 checks is so painful

Understandably I was confused and also curious.

> 13 checks?

And he responded

> for rent

Then it clicked. He was writing out the next year
of rent checks. I hadn't heard of this tactic, but it
seemed pretty brilliant to me.

I'm a person that likes to automate tasks so I can
[do my best work](https://www.jason.af/yak-shaving).
I write scripts to automate even trivial tasks
that I repeat because I'm quite lazy.
I have everything possible set up on autopay so I
avoid having to write checks or manually submit
payments.

But what if you have to write physical checks?
My friend decided to front load the whole year
so that putting the check in the mail takes up
substantially less time for the remainder of
the year.

I think that's awesome.

Not everything can be automated, but it might
make sense to frontload some burdensome tasks
in order to get it out of the way.
