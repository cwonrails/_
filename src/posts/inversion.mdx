Notes from reading along with [Inversion](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/)
by Farnam Street.

This is a derivative from Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi who said
“invert, always invert”.

Inverting problems helps to provide a new perspective which can be extremely
helpful with those that are especially difficult. It's a powerful mental
model.

They then go on to say that "[avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance](https://fs.blog/2014/06/avoiding-stupidity/)"
which is very interesting to me. Thinking about it as _additive vs. subtractive_.
