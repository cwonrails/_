A while ago I open-sourced an exploration of mine I've been calling
[DesignQL](https://github.com/system-ui/designql). It's the result of a
lot of thinking I'd been doing regarding design tools, component
libraries, and theming, particularly within the lense of design systems.

It focuses on a few patterns that I noticed emerge during my research
and work building projects like Tachyons, Compositor, Gatsby,
and other experiments.

- programmatic access to design systems
- automating documentation generation
- design tokens are interrelated and self-referencing via scales and composition

## Programmatic access to design systems

Design systems are living organisms, which means that there needs to be
ways for the system to evolve. This means reading and writing from the
many systems and render targets that might exist within a company that
uses or implements a design system.

This means bidirectional updating. This means integration with the many
different tools used within an organization.

I see something like DesignQL being the "nucleus" that handles the
multiplexing and demultiplexing of design system data. Input can come
from many sources, and be synthesized into a single representation based
on some sort of schema.

That same schema can then have any arbitrary number of "outputs" or "render
targets".

## Automating documentation

Documentation is an important aspect of a design system, since it's an
integral part of the living organism that is your design system. Similarly to
how Gatsby's data layer works, tools can plug into the theme and component
data to automate the documentation process by generating props tables, playgrounds,
and other information.

## Design Graphs and Theme UI

When conceptualizing DesignQL, a key pattern I noticed was the interrelation between
the primitives of a theme and components. A theme will often consist of a collection
of values and scales like typography, space, and color which will be composed into
other styles and variants within a system.

I never elaborated too much here, so I was delighted to see Brent Jackson's work on
defining the Design Graph. It more succinctly and elegantly describes similar concepts.

In essence, with the advent of the Design Graph, DesignQL is an implementation of the
Design Graph. The Design Graph represents the theme itself, and its connections to variants
and other components in a design system.

Theme UI is an _output_ of DesignQL and another implementation of the Design Graph.

## Leveraging existing technology

By leveraging the [System UI Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme) and
DesignQL, we allow for the most potential for interoperability. Not to mention, GraphQL's
penchant for discoverability via tools like GraphiQL makes it exceptionally compelling.

## Opening up new doors

In addition to allowing for more fluid evolution of a design system and automating
documentation, this allows us to operate at a new level of abstraction. Hypothetically,
it'd allow folks to experiment with tweaks to a design system and see how it plays out
on staging environments for production websites, apps, and even design tools.

Another interesting possibility is being able to see the greater dependency graph for
a component or collection of components. Tooling can "zoom in" and "zoom out" for more or
less information. Where is a component used? What prop variations are used? Which props
are most common?

This allows for designers and developers to visualize the context with the aid of
computers rather than having to maintain all that context in their heads (which
is what we do right now).
