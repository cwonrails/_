Inspired by the automating CI release workflows that
[next.js][] and [gatsby-mdx][] implemented, I decided to
give it a shot with GitHub [Actions][] for a project
I'm working on.

## Motivation

Canary deployments/releases have been around for a long
time in software. They're a great way to get new features
and bugfixes out to a small amount of users right away.
This results in a quick feedback loop for motivated users
of a product or library.

For busy OSS developers, it comes with another big advantage.
Automating canary/ci releases results in less manual publishes
allowing you to stick to some type of release cycle while
still ensuring new code is available for those who want it.
This means a few minutes after you click that green "merge"
button a new ci release is live and can be installed with
`npm i -S library-name@ci`.

Without implementing this automated workflow it requires
someone on the team to pull down the new code, run the
tests, and then run the release script. This then gets
even more complicated if you're using
[npm 2FA and lerna][lerna-otp].

So, with a little napkin math, once a PR is merged it takes

- 15 mins to release (worst case)
- spread across 10 active projects
- with a handful of PRs a day

I'm not sure I can even do this math on my napkin, but it
sounds like a lot. Especially if you factor in the cost
of context shifts and that 15 minutes really means 60
minutes in developer time due to that context shift.

_tl;dr_ it saves substantial time for project maintainers
while improving the end experience for library users.

## Let's get started

The project in this example is some of my experimentation with [Gatsby][]
[themes][] and consists of yarn workspaces and [lerna][].
As a result, the existing Actions workflows weren't a
proper fit since I needed a wrapper around yarn and
the git binary in the Docker image so that lerna could
perform the publish step.

In order to meet these needs I built out a quick
action inspired by [actions/npm] and
[nuxt/actions-yarn][] called [johno/actions-yarn][].

I'll likely write a quick post in the future on
how to achieve that.

## Setting up a workflow

I like to start building out my workflow with
it's entrypoint and the final action. First we define
the workflow with its name, and the final action
that it resolves, in this case "npm:publish:ci".

_NOTE_: I prefer to namespace action names with the workflow
name, but that's just a personal preference. Any
naming convention works.

```tf
workflow "npm" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["npm:publish:ci"]
}
```

Then, I define the "npm:publish:ci" action by
specifying the action it will use (our custom action above)
and the arguments that will be passed to yarn. In
this project I've defined a `publish:ci` script like
so:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "yarn publish:ci": "lerna publish -y --canary --preid ci --npm-tag=ci --force-publish=*"
  }
}
```

The action:

```tf
action "npm:publish:ci" {
  uses = "johno/actions-yarn@master"
  secrets = []
  args = "publish:ci"
  needs = []
}
```

## Filtering the master branch

The first step we want to make is to filter on the
master branch. This means that a commit needs to hit
master in order to continue with this workflow.

This is important so that we're only publishing
what's been approved and deemed stable.

```tf
action "npm:master" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@b2bea07"
  args = "branch master"
}
```

## Performing the install

Then we define an action, that depends on
`npm:master` and runs `yarn install`:

```tf
action "npm:publish:ci" {
  uses = "johno/actions-yarn@master"
  secrets = []
  args = "install"
  needs = ["npm:master"]
}
```

## Publishing

Lastly, we finish filling out the `npm:publish:ci`
action by specifying `needs = ["npm:install"]` to
ensure it's performed afterwards.

### Creating a bot account for ci releases

I recommend keeping 2FA on your primary npm account
and creating a new one (I use johno-bot) and uploading
a token for that user to your workflow in the
GitHub UI (found when editing your workflow on the site).

This ensures that your main releases are more
secure/trusted in the event that your npm account
is compromised. Bad actors publishing to a
`ci` tag is substantially lower risk.

### Adding secrets

We also add in `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`
secrets so that lerna can perform the publish
with the bot account.

```tf
action "npm:publish:ci" {
  uses = "johno/actions-yarn@master"
  secrets = [
    "NPM_AUTH_TOKEN",
    "GITHUB_TOKEN",
  ]
  args = "publish:ci"
  needs = ["npm:install]
}
```

## Conclusion

Automating publishing to a `ci` tag is a great way
to save yourself time and improving the DX for users
of your libraries. It's also rad to be able to implement
this entirely in GitHub.

Now, I suppose it's time to add tests to this repo
so that I can add a testing action to this workflow...

Thanks to the GitHub team for building Actions.
Thankts to [Tim Neutkens][tim] and [Chris Biscardi][chris]
for motivating me to start using this worklow.
