Typically unified and MDX (which uses unified under the hood)
are used as both a parser and compiler in one pass. This is
what unified calls "processing".

However, sometimes you might already have the AST and you want
to "compile" it. You can do that by calling `stringify` from
unified.

In order to do so you'll need to pull in both `remark-stringify` and
`remark-mdx` because the MDX compiler extends remark.

So, first we can grab the AST by parsing:

```js
const unified = require('unified')
const remarkParse = require('remark-parse')
const remarkMdx = require('remark-mdx')

const src = `
# Hello, world!

<div>!!!</div>
`

const ast = unified().use(remarkParse).use(remarkMdx).parse(src)
```

Then we can stringify it:

```js
const unified = require('unified')
const remarkStringify = require('remark-stringify')
const remarkMdx = require('remark-mdx')

// AST code removed for brevity

const mdx = unified().use(remarkStringify).use(remarkMdx).stringify(ast)

console.log(mdx)
```

We can then refactor this a bit so we can call
parse and stringify on the same instance of unified:

```js
const unified = require('unified')
const remarkParse = require('remark-parse')
const remarkStringify = require('remark-stringify')
const remarkMdx = require('remark-mdx')

const u = unified().use(remarkParse).use(remarkStringify).use(remarkMdx)

const src = `
# Hello, world!

<div>!!!</div>
`

const ast = u.parse(src)
const mdx = u.stringify(src)

console.log(mdx)
```

Now, we're parsing the AST and then stringifying the AST back to
MDX.
