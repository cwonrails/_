import { useState } from 'react'

MDX is frequently used to embed components that
are dynamic, it's one of its key features. It's my
favorite part, particularly for educational posts
on complex topics.

You can make things interactive.

But, you can do more, too.

Sometimes I don't need, or want, to create separate
components for small things that will never be used
outside of a particular MDX file. This can include
something interactive or related to data. You can
achieve this _inside_ your MDX file with React
hooks.

```mdx
import { useState } from 'react'

# Here's a button, click it!

export const MyDynamicButton = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Clicked {count} times!</button>
  )
}

Click it! <MyDynamicButton />
```

**Note**: It's important that you don't include any
empty lines in the code block since there's currently
a [parsing bug](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/195)
that will hopefully be addressed in v2.

That's it. Here's the exact code in the code block copied
over into the very MDX file I wrote this post with:

export const MyDynamicButton = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Clicked {count} times!</button>
  )
}

Click it! <MyDynamicButton />
