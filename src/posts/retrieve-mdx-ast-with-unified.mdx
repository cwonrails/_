Typically unified and MDX (which uses unified under the hood)
are used as both a parser and compiler in one pass. This is
what unified calls "processing".

However, sometimes you might _only_ want the AST. Maybe that's
what you want to store in the database, or you want to partition
the AST into multiple, smaller ASTs. With unified you can do
this by calling `parse`.

In order to do so you'll need to pull in both `remark-parse` and
`remark-mdx` because the MDX parser extends remark.

```js
const unified = require('unified')
const remarkParse = require('remark-parse')
const remarkMdx = require('remark-mdx')

const src = `
# Hello, world!

<div>!!!</div>
`

const ast = unified().use(remarkParse).use(remarkMdx).parse(src)

console.log(ast)
```

And just like that we have the MDX AST. If you're logging the AST to
inspect it, you can use `unist-util-inspect` to get a pretty print
version.

```js
const inspect = require('unist-util-inspect')

// AST code from above removed for brevity

console.log(inspect(ast))
```

This output is great for debugging because it's often easier to
read when you're working on a plugin or wanting to see the AST's
structure.
