_**Please note** that using the `Function` constructor is
the equivalent to `eval`. Use it with caution because
it allows for XSS when used with user input._

When building things with JavaScript, sometimes you
might want to evaluate a string of JavaScript and
display it on the page somehow.

This is how playgrounds like [`react-live`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live)
run. In order to do this we need to break down
how the `Function` constructor in JavaScript
works.

## Arguments

When we initialize a function we can pass it any
number of argument names and then the function
body itself.

Those argument names will then be added to the
scope. So, if you need two arguments, "a" and "b",
you can initialize your function like so:

```js
const multiply = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a * b')
```

This looks pretty similar to how you might normally
write it:

```js
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b
}
```

This function can then be called in the same fashion
as any other function:

```js
multiply(2, 4) // => 8
```

## Rendering React components

Now that we've successfully inline evaluated a JavaScript
string we can do more interesting things like render
React components.

In order to achieve this we need to create some scope which
will be available to the component string (for now we'll use
`React.createElement` to avoid transpiling). In order to do
this we can pass everything as function arguments:

```js
import React from 'react'

const Hello = () => <h1>World</h1>

const InlineRender ({ code }) => {
  const scope = { React, Hello }
  const scopeKeys = Object.keys(scope)
  const scopeValues = Object.values(scope)

  const fn = new Function(
    ...scopeKeys,
    `const ___Component = () => (${code});
    return React.createElement(___Component)`
  )

  return fn(...scopeValues)
}
```

We can then use the `InlineRender` component like so:

```js
<InlineRender code="React.createElement(Hello)" />
```

This is pretty powerful, but we can already anticipate folks
wanting to be able to write pure JSX. So, we'll need to use
a Babel transform.

```js
import { transform } from '@babel/standalone'
import babelPluginTransformJsx from '@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx'

const transformSrc = code => {
  const result = transform(code, {
    plugins: [babelPluginTransformJsx]
  })

  return result.code
}
```

All together:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { transform } from '@babel/standalone'
import babelPluginTransformJsx from '@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx'

const Hello = () => <h1>World</h1>

const InlineRender ({ code }) => {
  const scope = { React, Hello }
  const scopeKeys = Object.keys(scope)
  const scopeValues = Object.values(scope)

  let transformedCode = null
  try {
    transformedCode = transformSrc(code)
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
  }

  if (!transformedCode) {
    return null
  }

  const fn = new Function(
    ...scopeKeys,
    `const ___Component = () => (${transformedCode});
    return React.createElement(___Component)`
  )

  return fn(...scopeValues)
}

const transformSrc = code => {
  const result = transform(code, {
    plugins: [babelPluginTransformJsx]
  })

  return result.code
}
```

You'll notice that we need to error handle the babel
transform. This handles scenarios where a user might
be writing code into a textarea. While it's being typed
there will be invalid states.

In the perfect world you can memoize the last valid state
of the code, so rendering doesn't flash, but this gets
you most of the way.

Now, you can use JSX code:

```js
<InlineRender code="<Hello />" />
```

## Conclusion

Using the `Function` constructor with a babel transform is
a powerful way to build your own in-browser playground.
At its core, this is a strategy we use in
[Blocks](https://github.com/blocks/blocks/blob/9438282b7a4d648322493c94573522bbbfe5f3dd/packages/blocks-ui/src/inline-render.js)
as well.
