When you're working with an MDX document you might need
to figure out what props are being passed. You can use
a neat JSX debug trick to do so:

```mdx
# Hello, world!

<pre>{JSON.stringify(props, null, 2)}</pre>
```

The `JSON.stringify` turns the props object into a string
and the `2` argument adds two space indentation to the
resulting string which is passed to the `pre` tag which
preserves formatting.
