Composition is powerful because it's a "simple" abstraction that's
meant to combine functionality between two otherwise separate parts.
It tends to be less leaky than configuration-based approaches and
avoids framework coupling in convention-based approaches.

In essence, composition can be boiled down to:

##### [Object composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition)

```js
const newThing = {
  ...someValues,
  color: 'tomato'
}
```

##### Or [functional composition](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)>):

```js
f(g(x))
```

For the purposes of this post we'll be mostly focusing on functional
composition and how it relates to components.

## Components over configuration

In the frontend world we're already operating with a compositional
abstraction, the very components we're working with day in and day
out. We operate with a syntactic wrapper (JSX) and pass data to
a tree of components to render UI. Technically speaking JSX is a
Domain Specific Language (DSL), but it's one that is generally accepted
in the wider community and really isn't much more than a shortcut
for function calls.

JSX and components provide an expressive way to express composition
that can cut out configuration in a lot of cases. This is a good thing
because composition is only introduced where it's invoked and doesn't
cause global side effects.

### Natural layering

Component composition allows you to layer specific needs.

##### Components can be wrapped

```js
<ResponsiveIframe>
  <Youtube id="12345" />
</ResponsiveIframe>
```

##### Components can be siblings

```js
<Image src="12345" alt="numbers" />
<Citation photographer="Fred Flintstone" />
```

##### Components can be abstracted

```js
<ImageWithCitation src="12345" alt="numbers" photography="Fred Flintstone" />
```

### Combining common elements

In the above example you might find that as a project evolves that
all Youtube components are accompanied by a wrapping ResponsiveIframe
component. After that pattern becomes solidifed you can create a
new component, ResponsiveYoutube and begin using that in its place.

What makes this especially powerful is the fact that you don't have
to immediately port the existing usage right away. That can happen
over time. Additionally, when there are edge cases that need some type
of one-off functionality you find yourself working at the component
layer rather than overloading a plugin, syntax, or configuration option.

### Breaking them back apart

Similarly to Legos you can break apart components when further customization
is needed. Libraries can expose more "batteries included" components as
the primary API surface area which can be broken back apart to create something
more bespoke.

## Configuration is (typically) global

In most cases, configuration is applied globally to a project or framework.
For example, let's consider remark plugins in [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org).

When you apply a plugin to the global remark transformer it will affect
every document in the project. This can be problematic when you just need
to add in a responsive Youtube embed in a single Markdown file. What's also
interesting, is a project will typically _already_ have a Youtube component
that's used somewhere else (perhaps in a JSX-based page).

## Suboptimal workflow

The plugin workflow also departs from the parts of the project you're spending
most of your time in. If you're building for the web you're typically writing
content or building components for new pages, layouts, etc. You're operating
at an abstraction layer that's typically above the notion of configuration and
plugins (which is a good thing!).

## Composition is evolving

React Hooks introduce a new method of composition in components that provide
the power of mixins without the drawbacks. Granted, Hooks, have a lot of
[prior art](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#what-is-the-prior-art-for-hooks),
but their introduction makes it more accessible to framework users and it's
built in.

## Conclusion

Configuration-based systems are necessary at low-levels to ensure underlying
tooling is flexible. This posts isn't meant as a jab at any of the tools we
use on a day-to-day basis. In fact, I love that they're so flexible and pluggable
so we can focus time and energy on making those tools bulletproof for the greater
community. However, for the vast majority of developers, we can work at the
next layer of abstraction which can, and should, favor composition.
