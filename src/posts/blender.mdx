Blender is a free and open-source tool for 3D creation.
It features tooling for modeling, animating, rendering,
simulating and much more.

Adam Morse has been telling me this software is quite
radical, so I'm finally going to get after learning it.

Let's see what all the fuss is about.

## Downloading and installing

The software itself is a desktop app that can be run
on most popular OSes.
