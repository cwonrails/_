In git it's important that all references to a file are **relative to the
git repo itself**. I get this backwards _all the time_.

So, if you want to link the `docs/readme.md` to
`packages/som-package-name/readme.md`
(the original source file) you must operate relative
to your destination file:

**Create the directory**

```
❯ mkdir docs
```

**Change to the directory**

```
❯ cd docs
```

**Create the symbolic link with the original file**

```
❯ ln -s ../packages/gatsby-theme-documentation/readme.md readme.md
```

**List out the contents of the directory**

```
❯ ls
readme.md
```

Now, you can update either file and it will be properly updated and GitHub
will nicely render it, too.
