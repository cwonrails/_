I use images pretty sparingly on my site, so I don't use
Gatsby's image handling to keep my site develop/build as
minimal as possible.

So, I have a bit of a hack that I use to host my images,
by taking advantage of (abusing) GitHub's issue image hosting.

When there's an image I want to add to a blog post, I
open up a new GitHub issue for any arbitrary repo and then
drag and drop it into the editor. Then, I copy paste the
URL into Markdown image syntax.

I haven't noticed any outages or images being taken offline.
Generally speaking, I am hosting maybe a handful of (optimized) images
over more than a hundred pages so I can't imagine I trip
any alerts.

Some day I should create my own image service that let's me
drag and drop images onto a page and then automatically uploads
them to a self-hosted S3 bucket. Some. Day.

In the meantime, thanks GitHub. Love you.
