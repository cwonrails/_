Porting a blog to Gatsby is the perfect time to rethink
your url structure. My previous blog implementation used
Jekyll and used the default date structure. This resulted
in ugly urls like `2020/12/12/name-of-post`. With my
new blog I wanted something flatter so the same post
would instead live at `/name-of-post`.

However, it's important to be a thoughtful web citizen
and ensure that your previous urls redirect to the new
path. With Gatsby, I decided to leverage frontmatter
and the `createRedirect` utility.

This allows me to use frontmatter like the following:

```yaml
title: Some random title
date: 2020-12-12
redirects:
  - /2020/12/12/some-random-title
  - /some/other/old/path
```

This way, from the context of the post, I can reference
any old urls as a yaml array, and then handle the
actual redirects programmatically during page creation
for the post.

```js
mdxPages.edges.forEach(({ node }) => {
  const {
    frontmatter: { path, redirects }
  } = node

  if (redirects) {
    redirects.forEach(fromPath => {
      createRedirect({
        fromPath,
        toPath: path,
        redirectInBrowser: true,
        isPermanent: true
      })
    })
  }

  createPage({
    path,
    context: node,
    component: PostPage
  })
})
```

Above, this code checks for the existence of
redirects and creates a redirect for each one.

Lastly, we need to also add `gatsby-plugin-meta-redirect`
to `gatsby-config.js` so that an HTML file is
created for each created redirect on build. The
HTML file consists of a meta tag to redirect to
the new location.

This allows us to create redirects for a statically
generated site without having to mess with routing
at the network layer (like a redirects file for ZEIT's
Now or Netlify).
