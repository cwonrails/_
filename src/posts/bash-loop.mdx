## For loop

```sh
#!/bin/sh
for f in a b c
do
  echo "Hello, $f"
done
```

### Looping over files

In addition to passing what will be iterated over in
the for loop, you can also pass it files dynamically.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
for f in *.mdx
do
  echo "Hello, $f"
done
```

## Infinite while loop

If you want to repeatedly run a script or command you
can use an infinite bash while loop. If you want to
pause between invocations you can also call `sleep`.

Below we will run yarn build and then sleep for ten
seconds. Then repeat. Until the script is stopped.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
while [ true ]
do
    yarn build
    sleep 10
done
```

Note: Don't forget to `chmod +x SCRIPT_NAME.sh` so
that you can invoke as `./SCRIPT_NAME.sh`.
