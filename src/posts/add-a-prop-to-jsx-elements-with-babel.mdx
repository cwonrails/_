When you're processing a JSX AST you might want to
add an additional property.

We do this in [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/334125d94148d46110a799811e52b6d44ee3a79c/packages/babel-plugin-apply-mdx-type-props/index.js#L21-L26)
so that our [custom pragma](/jsx-pragma) knows the originating
element type when rendering. We do this in
[Blocks](https://github.com/blocks/blocks/blob/9438282b7a4d648322493c94573522bbbfe5f3dd/packages/blocks-ui/src/babel-plugins/add-tuid-prop.js#L9-L32)
in order to add a unique identifier property so we can later
transform, remove, and reorder elements in a visual editor.

In order to add a property, we first need to visit all
JSX elements. We can directly visit the JSX opening element
since it will contain all prop information.

It's a more specific visitor than JSXElement. JSXOpeningElement
is a child, or descendent, of JSXElement.

```js
export default api => {
  const { types: t } = api

  return {
    visitor: {
      JSXOpeningElement(path) {
        console.log(path)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We'll now be logging out the full path of the node.
This means that it has additional information than just
the AST node itself. This means we have access to ancestral
information, its children, and convenient helper methods
for working with the AST.

We won't need to use any of this for now, but it's
useful if you're creating more complex transformations.

Now, let's say we want to add `favoriteColor='tomato'` as
a prop to all JSX elements, we can now add that to our
visitor.

First we have to construct the AST representation of the
prop:

```js
export default api => {
  const { types: t } = api

  return {
    visitor: {
      JSXOpeningElement(path) {
        const newProp = t.jSXAttribute(
          t.jSXIdentifier('favoriteColor'),
          t.stringLiteral('tomato')
        )
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then we need to add it to the element itself:

```js
export default api => {
  const { types: t } = api

  return {
    visitor: {
      JSXOpeningElement(path) {
        const newProp = t.jSXAttribute(
          t.jSXIdentifier('favoriteColor'),
          t.stringLiteral('tomato')
        )

        path.node.attributes.push(newProp)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now the following input:

```js
<Hello />
```

Will result in:

```js
<Hello favoriteColor="tomato" />
```

Though, what happens if there's already a `favoriteColor` prop?

```js
<Hello favoriteColor="purple" />
```

Would result in:

```js
<Hello favoriteColor="purple" favoriteColor="tomato" />
```

Ultimately, with JSX this will still result in the desired
outcome because our new prop will override the existing.
But, it doesn't look as nice as what we'd actually write.

So, we can check for the existence of the prop and override
it if it exists:

```js
export default api => {
  const { types: t } = api

  return {
    visitor: {
      JSXOpeningElement(path) {
        const existingProp = path.node.attributes.find(
          node => node.name && node.name.name === 'favoriteColor'
        )

        if (existingProp) {
          existingProp.node.value.value === 'tomato'
          return
        }

        const newProp = t.jSXAttribute(
          t.jSXIdentifier('favoriteColor'),
          t.stringLiteral('tomato')
        )

        path.node.attributes.push(newProp)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And now the following input:

```js
<Hello favoriteColor="purple" />
```

Would result in:

```js
<Hello favoriteColor="tomato" />
```
