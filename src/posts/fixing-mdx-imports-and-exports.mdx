PR: https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/pull/399

As [MDX][mdx] gets more usage we've been experiencing some growing pains with our import/export parsing.
There have been two type primary types of bugs that are a direct result of using regexes rather than a formal parser like [babel][].
With MDX, we handle imports and exports during the tokenization phase by naively checking them.
Until now this has worked _okay_, but it breaks in weird ways, especially with default exports.

## Imports in MDX

With MDX you can import components, libraries, or other MDX documents.
This lets users do interesting things like:

```js
import { Component } from '../components'

# Hello, component!

<Component />
```

## Exports in MDX

Exports in MDX are powerful because they allow document authors to emit data similarly to frontmatter.
Though, they're a bit different because they're pure JavaScript which lets you use imports to make your exports more dynamic without having to create a custom plugin to map author names to author data.

In my opinion, this more clearly indicates intent and is more intuitive than frontmatter-style implementations.
Also, since MDX supports [remark][] plugins, you can use frontmatter if you'd like anyway!

```js
import authors from '../data/authors'

export const metadata = {
  authors: [authors.fred, authors.velma],
  tags: props.tags
}
```

### The default export

The default export, in particular, is important because we handle it in a special way.
It's used as the wrapper element for the MDX content.
MDX users leverage this as a way to specify an export at the document level.

This is also the source of some bugs.

#### Grouped exports

With our hacky regex-based default export detection we are unable to properly parse out the default export when they're grouped together.
This is brittle and a terrible developer experience (DX).

```js
import Layout from '../ui'

export default Layout
export const metadata = {
  some: 'stuff'
}

# Markdown content

...
```

This is not ideal because it's proper syntax, and is confusing to the user when they're forced to add unnecessary newlines.

#### Newline separation beween imports and exports

If your imports and exports aren't separated by newlines it causes issues

```js
import Layout from '../ui'
export default Layout
```

This is quite a bummer and shows how brittle MDX handling of exports can be.
MDX shouldn't require particular formatting for exports to work, that's up to the user or [prettier][].

## Why didn't you start with babel?

It's probably best to start with why this problem exists now that it's been described.
Ultimately it boils down to the fact that software is about tradeoffs and sometimes you just need to ship.

We consciously chose to build the initial implementation of MDX without using babel in order to keep it as lightweight as possible.
I firmly think this was the right decision at the time since it's sometimes too easy to reach for large tools to solve a single, small problem.
However, MDX has grown beyond our wildest dreams and folks are building things more advanced than we ever imagined.

As such, we've reached the tipping point to solve this "The Right Way".

## Getting started with the fix

###### _Note_: This is written as a step by step guide of my development process when implementing the fix. It's the first of a series I'm beginning where I write about my work on OSS while I code it.

### Installing dependencies

The first thing I need to do is add the babel parsing and any syntactic plugins we need.
We have a [test](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/14d9b19a8998cf39c0e09acceadfc03041a9a128/packages/mdx/test/index.test.js#L19-L25)
that shows the expected plugins for parsing that includes JSX syntax and handling
[object rest spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).

```sh
yarn workspace remark-mdx add @babel/core @babel/plugin-syntax-jsx @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
```

### Writing some fixtures

I knew I'd written a comment somewhere on GitHub that outlined some of the parsing issues so I searched around for a bit,
luckily GitHub search is decent so I was able to [dig it up](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/345#issuecomment-445938464).

For the default export I needed to pull out the default export it and assign it as a variable.

```js
// packages/remark-mdx/tests/fixtures/exports.js
module.exports = [
  {
    description: 'Handles basic usecase of default export',
    mdx: 'export default props => <article {...props} />'
  },
  {
    description: 'Handles an import that is later exported',
    mdx: ["import Layout from './Foo'", '', 'export default Layout'].join('\n')
  },
  {
    description: 'Separates import from the default export',
    mdx: [
      "import Foo from './foo'",
      'export default props => <article {...props} />'
    ].join('\n')
  },
  {
    description: 'Handles other types of exports',
    mdx: 'export const metadata = { some: "stuff" }'
  }
]
```

These fixtures aren't exhaustive, but there are plenty to get started.
It's time to write the tests for the fixtures.

### Writing the failing test

```sh
cp packages/remark-mdx/tests/inline-parsing.test.js packages/remark-mdx/tests/export-parsing.test.js
```

I then modified the test to pull in the proper test fixtures.

```js
const remarkMDX = require('..')
const mdx = require('../../mdx')

const fixtures = require('./fixtures/exports')

fixtures.forEach(fixture => {
  it(fixture.description, async () => {
    const result = await mdx(fixture.mdx)

    expect(result.trim()).toContain(fixture.result)
  })
})
```

Then we could run the tests and ensure they're failing like we expect.

```
yarn workspace remark-mdx test
```

#### An example failure

For the second example, with the export default not separated by empty line we will expect it to fail since we haven't begun parsing import/export nodes.
We will get output like the following:

```
  ● Separates import from the default export

    expect(string).toContain(value)

    Expected string:
      "import Foo from './foo'
    export default props => <article {...props} />

    const layoutProps = {

    };
    export default class MDXContent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.layout = null
      }
      render() {
        const { components, ...props } = this.props

        return <MDXTag
                 name=\"wrapper\"

                 components={components}>
               </MDXTag>
      }
    }"
    To contain value:
      "import Foo from './foo'
    const __MDXLayout__ = props => <article {...props} />"

       8 |     const result = await mdx(fixture.mdx)
       9 |
    > 10 |     expect(result.trim()).toContain(fixture.result)
         |                           ^
      11 |   })
      12 | })
      13 |
```

### Separating imports and exports

The MDX parser will collect import and export nodes by
[tokenizing them](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/14d9b19a8998cf39c0e09acceadfc03041a9a128/packages/remark-mdx/index.js#L101-L119)
but it doesn't currently parse separate imports/exports in the same block.
It continues to [`eat`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-parse#eatsubvalue)
up to the next empty newline. We still want to continue
eating up to the next empty newline since MDX requires empty lines to separate
import/export/JSX syntax from Markdown. However, we also want to split up
imports and exports into their [own nodes](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification#ast).

This is where babel comes in. When we encounter an import or export node
we will first unpack it and separate each import and export before
creating a new node or nodes in the AST.

#### Using a module

The first thing that jumps out to me here is that I'm going to want to
get more "low-level" with my initial tests without having to pass them
all the way through to MDX core. I'd like to be able to pass a string to a function
that uses babel and gives me an object pack of node types and their
values which I can then use with `remark`'s `eat` function.

I create a new file:

```js
// packages/remark-mdx/extract-imports-and-exports.js
function tokenizeEsSyntax(eat, value) {
  const index = value.indexOf(EMPTY_NEWLINE)
  const subvalue = index !== -1 ? value.slice(0, index) : value

  if (isExport(subvalue) || isImport(subvalue)) {
    const [first, ...rest] = extractImportsAndExports(subvalue)

    eat(subvalue)(first)

    rest.forEach(node => eat('')(node))
  }
}
```

And then scaffold out our new module:

```js
// extract-imports-and-exports
module.exports = value => {
  const nodes = []

  // Parse all the things

  return nodes
}
```

Then update our test:

```js
// packages/remark-mdx/test/export-parsing.test.js
const extract = require('../extract-imports-and-exports')

const fixtures = require('./fixtures/exports')

fixtures.forEach(fixture => {
  it(fixture.description, () => {
    const result = extract(fixture.mdx)

    expect(result).toMatchSnapshot(fixture.result)
  })
})
```

For now, we'll use snapshot testing since we basically just want to log diffs as we work on an implementation.

Then I consulted some projects that I'm familiar with and some that Google turns up:

#### Related babel code to draw "inspiration"

- [babel-plugin-get-jsx-props](https://github.com/c8r/babel-plugin-get-jsx-props)
- [babel-transform-imports](https://bitbucket.org/amctheatres/babel-transform-imports/src/3a2b5d4e3348?at=master)
- [gatsby-mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx/blob/1318430f5a0847ccfb09047c2d455fac7f5f29d0/packages/gatsby-mdx/utils/babel-plugin-gather-exports/index.js)

### Implementing a custom plugin

The goal here is to declare all possible visitors we're interested in for imports and exports.
For the first pass we just want to separate imports and exports.
Let's check the [AST docs](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/d349b74a4fd2c41a0342204ac9bbc9f0f484a845/packages/babel-parser/ast/spec.md)

What is of interest here is the [Module definitions](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/d349b74a4fd2c41a0342204ac9bbc9f0f484a845/packages/babel-parser/ast/spec.md#modules).

#### Visiting default export declarations

I decided to start with the default exports since they've been the most troublesome.

```js
const { transformSync } = require('@babel/core')
const generate = require('@babel/generator').default
const declare = require('@babel/helper-plugin-utils').declare

class BabelPluginExtractImportsAndExports {
  constructor() {
    this.state = { nodes: [] }

    this.plugin = declare(api => {
      api.assertVersion(7)

      return {
        visitor: {
          ExportDefaultDeclaration(path) {
            const declaration = path.node.declaration

            console.log(declaration)
          }
        }
      }
    })
  }
}

module.exports = value => {
  const instance = new BabelPluginExtractImportsAndExports()

  transformSync(value, {
    plugins: [
      '@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx',
      '@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread',
      instance.plugin
    ]
  })

  return instance.state.nodes
}
```

I needed to, once the default export declaration is visited, add it to the nodes state as raw code.
Babel's [generator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-generator) is the tool for the job.

#### Return the default export

```js
class BabelPluginExtractImportsAndExports {
  constructor(code) {
    const nodes = []
    this.state = { nodes }

    this.plugin = declare(api => {
      api.assertVersion(7)

      return {
        visitor: {
          ExportDefaultDeclaration(path) {
            const declaration = path.node.declaration

            const value = generate(declaration, {}, code).code
            nodes.push({ type: 'export', value })
          }
        }
      }
    })
  }
}
```

Then I could run my test and verify there was output (it'd cause my snapshot to fail).

```sh
yarn workspace remark-mdx test
```

```sh
  ● Separates import from the default export

    expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()

    Received value does not match stored snapshot "Separates import from the default export: import Foo from './foo'
    const __MDXLayout__ = props => <article {...props} /> 1".

    - Snapshot
    + Received

    - Array []
    + Array [
    +   Object {
    +     "type": "export",
    +     "value": "props => <article {...props} />",
    +   },
    + ]
```

#### Return the import

I can't forget about imports either, it's mostly copy pasta from the default export.

```js
ImportDeclaration(path) {
  const declaration = path.node.declaration

  const value = generate(declaration, {}, code).code
  nodes.push({ type: 'import', value })
}
```

I updated the snapshot as well.

```
yarn workspace remark-mdx -u
```

### Handle named exports

Lastly, I needed to handle named exports which include things like metadata or component exports found in MDX documents.

```js
ExportNamedDeclaration(path) {
  const declaration = path.node.declaration
  const value = generate(declaration, {}, code).code

  nodes.push({ type: 'export', value })
}
```

Things are starting to look good now.
However, I noticed that the imports weren't being properly written out as code.
They are empty strings in the snapshots so I needed to figure out what was going on there.

So I started with a `console.log(declaration)`.
It was `undefined` so I changed it to `console.log(path.node)`.
This had node data and I realized that the named imports/exports should be handled differently.

We only care about the declaration in the default exports since they're inlined into the MDX wrapper.
However, we want the entire node for the named imports/exports because they're used directly in the transpiled output.

Now we're left with:

```js
class BabelPluginExtractImportsAndExports {
  constructor(code) {
    const nodes = []
    this.state = { nodes }

    this.plugin = declare(api => {
      api.assertVersion(7)

      return {
        visitor: {
          ExportDefaultDeclaration(path) {
            const declaration = path.node.declaration
            const value = generate(declaration, {}, code).code

            nodes.push({ type: 'export', value })
          },
          ExportNamedDeclaration(path) {
            const value = generate(path.node, {}, code).code

            nodes.push({ type: 'export', value })
          },
          ImportDeclaration(path) {
            const value = generate(path.node, {}, code).code

            nodes.push({ type: 'import', value })
          }
        }
      }
    })
  }
}
```

#### Babel generator adds a semicolon

Weirdly enough, the generator added a trailing semicolon to the imports and named exports, so I hacked in a replace:

```js
const stripTrailingSemi = str => str.replace(/;$/, '')
```

#### Add default key to node

During the MDX transpilation, for the default export we check for the existence of a `default` key, so I needed to add that back in as well:

```js
ExportDefaultDeclaration(path) {
  const declaration = path.node.declaration
  const value = generate(declaration, {}, code).code

  nodes.push({ type: 'export', value, default: true })
}
```

## Wiring it all together

Now that we are parsing the imports and exports we need to update the tokenizer to use the exported nodes:

```js
function tokenizeEsSyntax(eat, value) {
  const index = value.indexOf(EMPTY_NEWLINE)
  const subvalue = index !== -1 ? value.slice(0, index) : value

  if (isExport(subvalue) || isImport(subvalue)) {
    const [first, ...rest] = extractImportsAndExports(subvalue)

    eat(subvalue)(first)

    rest.forEach(node => eat('')(node))
  }
}
```

### Test it all together

Currently, the remark-mdx library where we're adding these parsing improvements isn't
used in the core MDX library, so we will have to manually wire all the transpilation
plugins together:

```js
const transpile = mdx => {
  const result = unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkMDX)
    .use(mdxAstToMdxHast)
    .use(mdxHastToJsx)
    .processSync(mdx)

  return result.contents
}

it('correctly transpiles', () => {
  const result = transpile(FIXTURE)

  expect(result).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

## PR reviews

After [opening up a PR](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/pull/399)
for these changes, I received some feedback from @wooorm and @ChristopherBiscardi.

- https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/pull/399#pullrequestreview-202960560
- https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/pull/399#pullrequestreview-203519705

@wooorm's feedback is a bit more complex to address (but valid!) so we'll start with
@ChristopherBiscardi's.

### Improving test fixtures

Chris brought up a good point regarding ensuring we handle multiline exports.
Based on the way we're breaking up the nodes and parsing I'd be surprised if it
didn't work, but we should definitely be more thorough in our tests here to protect
against migrations.

I added a test for both a multiline export and a multiline default export.

```js
  {
    description: 'Handles multiline exports',
    mdx: [
      'export const metadata = {',
      '  some: "stuff"',
      '}'
    ].join('\n')
  },
  {
    description: 'Handles multiline default exports',
    mdx: [
      'export default props => (',
      '  <main {...props} />',
      ')'
    ].join('\n')
  }
```

```sh
yarn workspace remark-mdx test
```

I verified the snapshot and it all looks good.
Interestingly, I also noticed that babel was formatting the single line
const export to be formatted as a multiline. This is a bit of a bummer
because anyone transforming MDX with plugins and writing back to MDX
will be getting their JS blocks formatted differently. We can look into
that at another time.

### Preserving positional information

Titus brought up a good point as well regarding positional information.
Since we're eating up the export node with as `first` we lose all the positional
information of other nodes in that block.

Here's his comment in full:

> This way loses positional information, which could be a problem for tooling in the remark/mdx ecosystems (not for MDX -> JSX). Now `first` gets the positional info for the whole eaten value, and `rest` gets the position at the end of `value` as their start and end positions.
>
> You could use `eat.now()` first, to get the position we’re at, and then I’d believe babel in `extractImportsAndExports` has access to the positions of the import/export nodes, so you could patch the positions there.
>
> Then finally, you could `eat(subvalue)` to mark the text as parsed, but that not use the returned function, as the nodes already have position info attached?

This is definitely an issue I wasn't considering. We really want to
ensure the nodes are properly constructed with positional information.
We're going to have to merge babel and remark nodes more thoroughly.
This will also be a touch tricky since the code format that babel
generates won't be the exact substring that `eat` will want since
babel generate might modify the JS a bit.

#### Get positional information from babel

Naturally, my first step is to `console.log` the node in `ExportDefaultDeclaration`.
I then see that there's are `start` and `end` keys.
It appears they map directly to the declaration itself.
This is consistent with the [docs](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-parser/ast/spec.md#node-objects)

This is great, looks like we can just destructure the value and then `slice` it out:

```js
console.log(path.node)
const { start, end } = path.node
const raw = code.slice(start, end)
console.log(raw)
```

We get the exact output we expect. The raw string for the export. This now
allows us to handle the format issue discussed earlier. Rather than using
babel generate, we can pass the sliced value back and correctly use remark's
eat.

```js
class BabelPluginExtractImportsAndExports {
  constructor(code) {
    const nodes = []
    this.state = { nodes }

    this.plugin = declare(api => {
      api.assertVersion(7)

      return {
        visitor: {
          ExportDefaultDeclaration(path) {
            const { start, end } = path.node
            const value = code.slice(start, end)

            nodes.push({ type: 'export', value, default: true })
          },
          ExportNamedDeclaration(path) {
            const { start, end } = path.node
            const value = code.slice(start, end)

            nodes.push({ type: 'export', value })
          },
          ImportDeclaration(path) {
            const { start, end } = path.node
            const value = code.slice(start, end)

            nodes.push({ type: 'import', value })
          }
        }
      }
    })
  }
}
```

Then we can simplify the node creation for the AST:

```js
if (isExport(subvalue) || isImport(subvalue)) {
  const nodes = extractImportsAndExports(subvalue)

  nodes.map(node => {
    eat(node.value)(node)
  })
}
```

Now we can run the tests (which should fail!).

```sh
yarn workspace remark-mdx test
```

And then update the snapshots:

```sh
yarn workspace remark-mdx test
```

This is looking good, however there's still an error.

#### Fixing the `eat` error

```sh

  const nodes = extractImportsAndExports(subvalue)
  nodes.map(node => {
    console.log(node)
    eat(node.value)(node)
  })
}
```

It results in the following error:

```sh

This is useful because we're seeing that the error is occurring because we're eating the nodes
out of order! Whoops!

That means we need to add the `start` value to the nodes and then sort them before returning.
We should also strip back out the `start` so we're not emitting data that doesn't need to
be there. After all, as soon as `eat` happens, that same positional info will be added back.

```js
return instance.state.nodes
  .sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start)
  .map(({ start, ...node }) => node)
```

Unfortunately this didn't seem to fix it. I suspect it has to do with the newline being
missed. Since babel doesn't see the newlines between the different imports and exports
as part of the declarations, they're ignored. First thing I checked is whether babel
has a way to pull out this whitespace metadata. We could turn them into nodes and then
zip it back together.

##### Partitioning the string

It didn't look like babel supports that, so I decided to try another approach: partitioning
the string. From our babel parsing visitors we can return just the `start` value and
use that to slice the string itself into multiple parts.

In order to achieve this, we only need to return the `start` value of each node and
handle the partition after we sort the nodes.

```js
const partitionString = (str, indices) => {
  let index = 0

  return indices.reduce((acc, curr) => {
    index += 1
    const val = str.slice(curr, indices[index])
    acc.push(val)
    return acc
  }, [])
}

module.exports = value => {
  const instance = new BabelPluginExtractImportsAndExports(value)

  transformSync(value, {
    plugins: [
      '@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx',
      '@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread',
      instance.plugin
    ]
  })

  const sortedNodes = instance.state.nodes.sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start)
  const nodeStarts = sortedNodes.map(n => n.start)
  const values = partitionString(value, nodeStarts)

  return sortedNodes.map(({ start, ...node }, i) => {
    const value = values[i]
    return { ...node, value }
  })
}
```
